# /inspire-me - Competitive Analysis & Enhancement Planning

## Purpose

Execute comprehensive competitive analysis of ProRT-IP against industry leaders (Nmap, Masscan, RustScan, etc.), identify feature gaps and opportunities, and generate an 8-sprint enhancement roadmap for the current development phase.

**Use Case:** Run at end of each phase to discover competitive improvements before proceeding to next phase

**Duration:** ~3-4 hours for comprehensive analysis
**Output:** `docs/XX-PHASEXX-ENHANCEMENTS.md` + execution report

---

## OBJECTIVE

Generate phase-specific enhancement document by:
1. Analyzing reference code (`code_ref/`, GitHub repos, online sources)
2. Comparing with ProRT-IP's current implementation
3. Identifying gaps, opportunities, and innovations
4. Creating 8-sprint enhancement roadmap
5. Documenting findings comprehensively

---

## EXECUTION PHASES

```

---

## ERROR HANDLING

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **code_ref/ directory empty** | Skip local analysis, focus on online research. Note in report: "No local reference code available" |
| **GitHub API rate limited** | Use WebFetch for public repos (no auth needed). Fallback: Manual documentation review |
| **Unclear current phase** | Ask user for clarification. Default: Use "Phase X" placeholder, update after confirmation |
| **Insufficient competitive data** | Focus on top 3-4 competitors (Nmap, Masscan, RustScan). Document limitations in report |
| **Sprint planning uncertainty** | Prioritize high-ROI items. Include "needs user input" section for unclear priorities |
| **Performance data missing** | Use claimed/estimated values, mark as "unvalidated" or "claimed" in report |

---

## INTELLIGENCE FEATURES

### Smart Sprint Naming

Generate descriptive titles based on content:
- ✅ "Service Detection: SSL/TLS Support" (not "Sprint 4.15")
- ✅ "Performance: Batch Packet I/O" (not "Optimization Sprint")
- ✅ "UX: Multi-Page Help System" (not "Documentation Sprint")

### Adaptive Research Depth

Adjust based on findings:
- **Major gap found:** Deep dive into competitor implementation (read code, analyze algorithms)
- **Minor gap:** Brief analysis sufficient (note feature exists, estimate effort)
- **Innovation opportunity:** Explore cutting-edge research (recent papers, blog posts)

### Context-Aware Recommendations

Tailor sprints to ProRT-IP's architecture:
- **Rust-specific optimizations** (not C-style patterns)
- **Async/await patterns** (not thread pools)
- **Zero-copy techniques** (if ProRT-IP already uses this pattern)
- **Tokio ecosystem libraries** (not generic alternatives)
