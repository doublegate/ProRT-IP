/sub-agent THINK DEEPLY about memory bank optimization for this project. Your task is to comprehensively optimize all memory banks (CLAUDE.md files) through the following systematic process:

## Phase 1: ANALYSIS (Read & Understand)
- Read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (user memory - generic patterns across all projects)
- Read project CLAUDE.md (project-specific guidance for ProRT-IP)
- Read CLAUDE.local.md (project state, progress, recent sessions)
- Analyze information overlap, duplication, and relevance
- Identify stale/outdated information
- Map information by priority and access frequency

## Phase 2: ORGANIZE (Correct Placement)
- Ensure generic patterns stay in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- Ensure project-specific guidance stays in project CLAUDE.md
- Ensure current state/progress stays in CLAUDE.local.md
- Relocate misplaced information to appropriate banks
- Consolidate scattered related information

## Phase 3: PRIORITIZE (Accessibility)
- Most critical information at top of each section
- Frequently accessed patterns easily findable
- Recent/active information more prominent than historical
- Quick reference sections optimized
- Cross-references clear and minimal

## Phase 4: OPTIMIZE (Speed & Efficiency)
- Restructure for fast scanning/reading
- Use tables for dense information
- Use lists for quick reference
- Consolidate verbose explanations
- Improve section organization and headers

## Phase 5: ELIMINATE (Remove Redundancy)
- Identify truly duplicate information
- Confirm relevance before deletion (ask if uncertain)
- Remove completed/obsolete task tracking
- Archive historical information if no longer needed
- Eliminate redundant examples/explanations

## Phase 6: COMPRESS (Efficient Storage)
- Condense verbose prose to concise statements
- Use abbreviations where clear (e.g., "v0.3.0" not "version 0.3.0")
- Replace paragraphs with bullet points where appropriate
- Consolidate similar examples
- Use compact formatting (tables, lists)
- Remove unnecessary words while preserving meaning

## Phase 7: VERIFICATION (No Information Loss)
- Verify all critical information preserved
- Ensure technical accuracy maintained
- Confirm cross-references still valid
- Test that key patterns still accessible
- Validate no breaking changes to structure

## Success Criteria:
✅ Character count reduced by 20-40% across all memory banks
✅ No loss of critical project information
✅ Improved accessibility and readability
✅ Clear separation of concerns (user/project/local)
✅ All duplicates eliminated
✅ Stale information removed or archived
✅ Optimized structure for Claude Code access patterns

## Deliverables:
1. Analysis report: Current state, issues found, optimization plan
2. Updated ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (if generic patterns improved)
3. Updated project CLAUDE.md (optimized project guidance)
4. Updated CLAUDE.local.md (current state, recent sessions)
5. Summary: Character count before/after, changes made, improvements

IMPORTANT: Be thorough but conservative. When in doubt about relevance, keep the information. Prioritize compression and reorganization over deletion.
