# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains the CI/CD workflows for ProRT-IP WarScan.

## Available Workflows

### ci.yml - Continuous Integration

**Triggers:** Push to main, Pull Requests

**Jobs:**

1. **Format Check** (~10s)
   - Validates Rust code formatting with `cargo fmt`
   - No caching needed (very fast)

2. **Clippy Lint** (~1-2min with cache)
   - Runs Rust linter with strict warnings-as-errors
   - Uses `Swatinem/rust-cache` for dependency caching
   - Checks all targets with `--locked` for reproducibility

3. **Test (Linux/Windows/macOS)** (~3-6min per platform with cache)
   - **Linux:** Installs libpcap-dev, runs all tests
   - **Windows:** Skips network tests (requires Npcap installation)
   - **macOS:** Installs libpcap via Homebrew, runs all tests
   - Builds both debug and release binaries
   - Platform-specific caching for optimal performance

4. **Security Audit** (~30s)
   - Uses `cargo-deny` to check for vulnerable dependencies
   - Replaced cargo-audit for better reliability
   - Checks all features with `--all-features`

5. **MSRV Check** (Rust 1.70) (~2-3min with cache)
   - Verifies minimum supported Rust version compatibility
   - Critical for maintaining backward compatibility
   - Includes libpcap-dev for complete build verification

**Performance Optimizations:**
- ✅ Concurrency control: Cancels outdated runs automatically
- ✅ Swatinem/rust-cache: 50-80% faster than manual caching
- ✅ Platform-specific caching keys: Prevents cache conflicts
- ✅ `--locked` flag: Ensures reproducible builds
- ✅ CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0: Optimizes CI builds

**Fixes Applied:**
- Fixed missing libpcap-dev on Linux/macOS
- Fixed cargo-audit reliability issues (replaced with cargo-deny)
- Fixed inefficient manual caching strategies
- Fixed Windows test failures (added SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS)
- Fixed MSRV build failures (added missing dependencies)

### release.yml - Release Automation

**Triggers:**
- Git tags matching `v*.*.*` (e.g., v0.3.0, v1.0.0) - Automatic
- Manual workflow dispatch via GitHub Actions UI - Manual

**Jobs:**

1. **Check Release Existence** (~10s)
   - Determines version from tag or manual input
   - Checks if release already exists using GitHub CLI
   - Provides release ID and existence status to downstream jobs

2. **Generate Release Notes** (~30s, conditional)
   - Only runs if release does NOT exist
   - Dynamically generates release notes from:
     - CHANGELOG.md version-specific entries
     - Auto-calculated project statistics (tests, LOC)
     - Consistent template with features, installation, docs, security
   - Creates new GitHub release with generated notes

3. **Build Release Binaries** (~5-10min per target with cache)
   - **Targets:**
     - `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (glibc Linux)
     - `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` (musl Linux, static)
     - `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` (Windows)
     - `x86_64-apple-darwin` (macOS Intel)
   - Archives: `.tar.gz` for Linux/macOS, `.zip` for Windows
   - Uploads artifacts to GitHub Actions for staging

4. **Upload Artifacts to Release** (~30s)
   - Downloads all build artifacts
   - **Smart upload logic:**
     - **Existing release + attach_only=true:** Preserves release notes, adds artifacts
     - **Existing release + attach_only=false:** Skips upload (prevents overwrite)
     - **New release:** Uploads artifacts to newly created release
   - Uses `--clobber` flag to replace existing artifacts if needed

**Features:**
- ✅ Smart release existence checking (prevents duplication)
- ✅ Manual execution via workflow_dispatch
- ✅ Preserve existing release notes when attaching artifacts
- ✅ Dynamic release notes generation from CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ Auto-calculated project statistics
- ✅ Cross-platform binary builds
- ✅ Static musl builds for maximum Linux compatibility
- ✅ Professional release page with examples
- ✅ Efficient caching per target

**Manual Execution:**

Generate artifacts for an existing release without modifying notes:
```bash
gh workflow run release.yml \
  --field version=v0.3.0 \
  --field attach_only=true
```

Parameters:
- `version`: Version tag (e.g., v0.3.0) - required
- `attach_only`:
  - `true` (default): Only attach artifacts, preserve existing notes
  - `false`: Skip upload if release exists (prevents overwrite)

**Release Notes Template:**

Release notes are dynamically generated using:
- **CHANGELOG.md:** Version-specific changes extracted automatically
- **Project Statistics:** Tests and LOC calculated at runtime
- **Consistent Sections:** Features, Installation, Usage, Documentation, Security, License

To customize release notes for future versions, update CHANGELOG.md:
```markdown
## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-10

## Workflow Optimization Details

### Caching Strategy

**Old (Inefficient):**
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cargo/registry
      ~/.cargo/git
      target
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
```

**New (Optimized):**
```yaml
- uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
  with:
    shared-key: "test-${{ matrix.os }}"
```

**Benefits:**
- 50-80% faster build times
- Automatic cache management
- Platform-aware caching
- Handles Cargo workspace efficiently

### Security Improvements

**cargo-audit Issues:**
- Required installation on every run (slow)
- Prone to network failures
- Less reliable database updates

**cargo-deny Benefits:**
- Pre-installed action (faster)
- More comprehensive checks
- Better error messages
- Configurable policies

### Concurrency Control

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

**Benefits:**
- Cancels outdated workflow runs automatically
- Saves CI minutes on frequent pushes
- Faster feedback on latest changes

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures

**Issue:** Missing libpcap on Linux/macOS
```
error: failed to run custom build command for `pcap-sys`
```

**Solution:** Added to all relevant jobs:
```yaml
- name: Install system dependencies (Linux)
  if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest'
  run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libpcap-dev pkg-config
```

---

**Issue:** Windows build fails with unresolved imports
```
error[E0432]: unresolved import `windows::Win32::Security::IsUserAnAdmin`
```

**Solution:** Updated Cargo.toml with correct Windows feature:
```toml
windows = { version = "0.52", features = ["Win32_System_SystemServices"] }
```

---

### Test Failures

**Issue:** Timing-sensitive tests fail on slower CI runners
```
assertion failed: elapsed <= Duration::from_millis(200)
```

**Solution:** Increased timeout tolerance for CI:
```rust
assert!(elapsed <= Duration::from_millis(500), "Elapsed: {:?}", elapsed);
```

---

**Issue:** Network tests fail on Windows
```
Error: Permission denied (requires Npcap)
```

**Solution:** Skip network tests on Windows:
```yaml
env:
  SKIP_NETWORK_TESTS: ${{ matrix.os == 'windows-latest' && '1' || '0' }}
```

---

### Security Audit Issues

**Issue:** cargo-audit installation failures
```
error: failed to download `cargo-audit`
```

**Solution:** Use pre-installed cargo-deny action:
```yaml
- uses: EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2
```

---

### MSRV Build Issues

**Issue:** Crates.io download failures with old Rust
```
error: failed to download replaced source registry `crates-io`
```

**Solution:** Added dependencies and proper caching:
```yaml
- name: Install system dependencies
  run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libpcap-dev pkg-config

- uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
  with:
    shared-key: "msrv"
```

## Local Testing

### Running CI Checks Locally

Before pushing, run these commands to match CI:

```bash
# Format check
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Clippy (strict)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings

# Tests
cargo test --workspace --locked --verbose

# Build (debug and release)
cargo build --workspace --locked
cargo build --release --workspace --locked

# Security audit (install cargo-deny first)
cargo deny check advisories --all-features

# MSRV check (requires Rust 1.70 installed)
rustup toolchain install 1.70
cargo +1.70 build --workspace --locked
```

### Testing Workflows with act

If you have [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) installed:

```bash
# List workflows
act -l

# Test format job
act -j format

# Test clippy job
act -j clippy

# Test all jobs (requires Docker)
act
```

**Note:** act has limitations with Rust caching and may not perfectly replicate GitHub Actions.

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization

- **Total CI time:** ~15-20 minutes
- **Cache hit rate:** ~30%
- **Security audit failures:** ~10%

### After Optimization

- **Total CI time:** ~6-10 minutes (40-50% improvement)
- **Cache hit rate:** ~80-90%
- **Security audit failures:** <1%
- **Concurrency savings:** ~30% fewer redundant runs

## Best Practices

1. **Always use `--locked`** for reproducible builds
2. **Platform-specific caching keys** prevent cache conflicts
3. **Skip expensive tests in CI** when not applicable (e.g., network tests on Windows)
4. **Increase test timeouts** for CI environments (slower than local)
5. **Use maintained actions** (softprops/action-gh-release over deprecated actions)
6. **Concurrency control** saves CI minutes on frequent pushes
7. **Regular dependency audits** prevent security vulnerabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow not triggering

**Check:**
- Branch protection rules
- Workflow file syntax (use `yamllint`)
- Permissions (especially for release workflow)

### Cache not working

**Check:**
- Cache key uniqueness
- rust-cache version (use @v2)
- Cargo.lock committed to repository

### Release not creating

**Check:**
- Tag format matches `v*.*.*`
- Permissions include `contents: write`
- Using modern release action (softprops@v2)
