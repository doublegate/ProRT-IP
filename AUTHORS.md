## Acknowledgments

ProRT-IP WarScan stands on the shoulders of giants. We acknowledge and thank the following projects and communities:

### Inspirational Projects

#### Nmap (Network Mapper)
- **Project**: https://nmap.org/
- **License**: Nmap Public Source License (NPSL) / GPLv2
- **Contribution**: Pioneer of network scanning, service detection, and OS fingerprinting
- **Recognition**: ProRT-IP's service detection and OS fingerprinting strategies are inspired by Nmap's proven methodologies. We use compatible probe database formats (nmap-service-probes, nmap-os-db) to leverage decades of collective security research.
- **Creator**: Gordon "Fyodor" Lyon and the Nmap development team

#### Masscan
- **Project**: https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan
- **License**: AGPL-3.0
- **Contribution**: Demonstrated that stateless scanning can achieve 10M+ packets/second
- **Recognition**: ProRT-IP's stateless scanning architecture, including SYN cookie techniques and randomized packet ordering, is directly inspired by Masscan's innovations.
- **Creator**: Robert Graham

#### RustScan
- **Project**: https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan
- **License**: GPL-3.0
- **Contribution**: Proved viability of Rust for high-performance network scanning
- **Recognition**: RustScan's hybrid approach (fast port discovery â†’ pipe to Nmap) validated the two-phase scanning model that ProRT-IP adopts. Their success in the Rust security tools ecosystem paved the way for projects like ours.
- **Creators**: RustScan community

#### ZMap
- **Project**: https://zmap.io/
- **License**: Apache 2.0
- **Contribution**: Internet-scale scanning capabilities and research
- **Recognition**: ZMap's academic research on scanning performance, hit rates, and network impact informed ProRT-IP's design decisions. Their publications on stateless scanning are foundational to our approach.
- **Creators**: University of Michigan research team

### Rust Ecosystem

ProRT-IP WarScan is built on excellent Rust libraries and frameworks:

#### Tokio
- **Project**: https://tokio.rs/
- **License**: MIT
- **Contribution**: Async runtime with work-stealing scheduler
- **Recognition**: Tokio's performance and ergonomics make high-speed async packet processing practical in Rust. Their scheduler design directly enables ProRT-IP's concurrency model.
- **Maintainers**: Tokio contributors and Carl Lerche

#### pnet (Packet Network)
- **Project**: https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet
- **License**: MIT/Apache-2.0
- **Contribution**: Cross-platform packet manipulation
- **Recognition**: pnet provides the foundation for ProRT-IP's packet crafting and parsing, abstracting platform differences (AF_PACKET, Npcap, BPF).
- **Maintainers**: pnet contributors

#### etherparse
- **Project**: https://github.com/JulianSchmid/etherparse
- **License**: BSD-3-Clause
- **Contribution**: Zero-allocation packet parsing
- **Recognition**: etherparse's safe, efficient parsing is crucial for ProRT-IP's performance at high packet rates.
- **Creator**: Julian Schmid

#### crossbeam
- **Project**: https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam
- **License**: MIT/Apache-2.0
- **Contribution**: Lock-free data structures and concurrent algorithms
- **Recognition**: Crossbeam's channels and atomic utilities enable ProRT-IP's lock-free result collection critical for 1M+ pps performance.
- **Maintainers**: Crossbeam contributors

#### clap (Command Line Argument Parser)
- **Project**: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap
- **License**: MIT/Apache-2.0
- **Contribution**: Ergonomic CLI with derive macros
- **Recognition**: clap makes ProRT-IP's command-line interface powerful and user-friendly, following Unix conventions.
- **Maintainers**: clap-rs team

#### serde
- **Project**: https://serde.rs/
- **License**: MIT/Apache-2.0
- **Contribution**: Serialization framework
- **Recognition**: serde's zero-cost abstractions enable ProRT-IP's multiple output formats (JSON, XML, TOML) without performance penalty.
- **Creators**: David Tolnay and Erick Tryzelaar

### Other Notable Libraries

- **sqlx**: Async SQL with compile-time query checking
- **tracing**: Structured, composable logging
- **governor**: Token bucket rate limiting
