---

## Development Workflow

### Build Commands (Once Implemented)

```bash
# Development build
cargo build

# Release build (optimized)
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with specific scan
cargo run -- -sS -p 80,443 192.168.1.0/24

# Code quality
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Documentation
cargo doc --open

# Benchmarks
cargo bench
```

### Testing Strategy

**Test Levels:**
1. **Unit Tests:** Individual functions (target >90% coverage)
2. **Integration Tests:** Component interactions (target >80% coverage)
3. **System Tests:** End-to-end scenarios (Docker test network)
4. **Performance Tests:** Criterion benchmarks (1M+ pps target)
5. **Fuzz Tests:** Input validation (AFL, cargo-fuzz)

**Test Environment:**
- Docker containers for isolated test networks
- Mock services on ports 21, 22, 80, 443, 3306, 5432
- Wireshark captures for packet validation

---

## Security Considerations

### Privilege Management Pattern

```rust
// Phase 1 implementation requirement
pub fn setup_privileges() -> Result<()> {
    // 1. Check for required privileges
    if !has_raw_socket_capability()? {
        return Err(Error::InsufficientPrivileges);
    }

    // 2. Create raw socket
    let socket = create_raw_socket()?;

    // 3. Drop privileges (irreversible)
    drop_privileges("nobody", "nogroup")?;

    // 4. Verify cannot regain root
    assert!(setuid(0).is_err());

    Ok(())
}
```

### Input Validation Checklist

- ✅ IP address parsing (IPv4/IPv6)
- ✅ CIDR notation validation (0-32 for IPv4, 0-128 for IPv6)
- ✅ Port range validation (1-65535)
- ✅ Filename sanitization (output files)
- ✅ Rate limiting (prevent self-DoS)
- ✅ Memory limits (scan result bounds)

---

## Decision Log

### 2025-10-07: Rate Limiter Burst Configuration

**Decision:** Set rate limiter burst size to 10 tokens (10x refill rate per second)

**Rationale:**
- Allows initial burst of packets for better responsiveness
- Prevents excessive bursting that could overwhelm targets
- Balances performance with network courtesy
- Follows token bucket algorithm best practices

**Implementation:**
- `RateLimiter::new()` creates governor with burst=10
- Refill rate set per scan configuration
- Works well with all timing templates (T0-T5)

### 2025-10-07: Discovery Test Timeout Improvements

**Decision:** Increased host discovery test timeouts from 1s to 5s

**Rationale:**
- GitHub Actions runners have variable network performance
- Local network tests were passing, CI was intermittent
- 5-second timeout provides sufficient margin
- Still fast enough for test suite execution
- Prevents false failures in CI environment

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Mock network responses (too complex, loses integration testing value)
- Skip tests in CI (loses test coverage)
- Conditional timeouts based on environment (added complexity)

**Impact:**
- All 215 tests now pass reliably in CI
- Test suite runs in ~21 seconds (acceptable)
- Better reflects real-world network conditions

### 2025-10-07: Root-Level Documentation Structure

**Decision:** Create 5 separate root-level documentation files (CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, SUPPORT, AUTHORS, ROADMAP) plus enhanced README

**Rationale:**
- Follows GitHub community health file best practices
- Separates concerns (contributing vs security vs support)
- Makes navigation easier for different audiences
- Enables GitHub's automatic community health detection
- Provides clear entry points for users, contributors, security researchers

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Single comprehensive documentation file (too large, hard to navigate)
- Minimal documentation with just README (insufficient for open-source project)
- Documentation only in docs/ directory (GitHub doesn't recognize for community health)

**Implications:**
- GitHub will show community health indicators
- Clear onboarding paths for different contributor types
- Professional appearance for potential contributors
- Easier to maintain separate concerns

### 2025-10-07: LICENSE File Added

**Decision:** Create GPL-3.0 LICENSE file with security tool warning

**Rationale:**
- Completes Phase 1 deliverables
- Provides clear legal framework for open-source usage
- Includes security tool responsible use warning
- Ensures derivative works remain open source
- GitHub automatically detects and displays license

**Implementation:**
- Full GPL-3.0 license text with line wrapping
- Copyright notice: "Copyright (C) 2025 doublegate"
- Security tool usage warning section
- Contact information and responsible use guidance

**Impact:**
- Professional open-source repository
- Clear legal boundaries for contributors
- GitHub license badge now links to actual file

### 2025-10-07: Documentation Structure

**Decision:** Create numbered documentation files (00-10) with logical prefixes

**Rationale:**
- Provides suggested reading order for new developers
- Easy cross-referencing between documents
- Clear separation of concerns (architecture, roadmap, implementation, etc.)
- Scalable for future additions

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Flat structure without numbering (harder to navigate)
- Wiki-style separate repository (harder to version control)
- Single monolithic document (too large, hard to maintain)

### 2025-10-07: Git Branch Strategy

**Decision:** Use `main` as default branch (not `master`)

**Rationale:**
- Modern naming convention
- Aligns with GitHub defaults
- Inclusive terminology

### 2025-10-07: License Selection

**Decision:** GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)

**Rationale:**
- Ensures derivative works remain open source
- Protects against proprietary forks
- Aligns with security research community values
- Compatible with most open-source projects

**Implications:**
- All contributions must be GPLv3 compatible
- Proprietary use requires explicit permission/licensing
- Modifications must disclose source code

- [ ] Review CLAUDE.local.md for current status
- [ ] Check 10-PROJECT-STATUS.md for next tasks
- [ ] Review relevant documentation (architecture, implementation guide)
- [ ] Ensure development environment is set up (03-DEV-SETUP.md)

**During Session:**
- [ ] Update task status in 10-PROJECT-STATUS.md (in_progress → completed)
- [ ] Write tests first (TDD approach from 06-TESTING.md)
- [ ] Follow security guidelines (08-SECURITY.md)
- [ ] Run code quality checks (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`)
- [ ] Document public APIs with examples

**Post-Session:**
- [ ] Run full test suite (`cargo test`)
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.local.md with progress and decisions
- [ ] Commit changes with conventional commit message
- [ ] Push to remote repository
- [ ] Update 10-PROJECT-STATUS.md completion status
