## Overview

**ProRT-IP WarScan** is a modern network scanner written in Rust that combines:

- **Speed:** 1M+ packets/second stateless scanning (comparable to Masscan/ZMap)
- **Depth:** Comprehensive service detection and OS fingerprinting (like Nmap)
- **Safety:** Memory-safe Rust implementation prevents entire vulnerability classes
- **Stealth:** Advanced evasion techniques (timing, decoys, fragmentation, idle scans)
- **Extensibility:** Plugin system with Lua scripting support

**At a glance:**

- **Multi-Protocol Scanning:** TCP (SYN, Connect, FIN, NULL, Xmas, ACK, Idle), UDP, ICMP
- **Service Detection:** 187 protocol probes + SSL/TLS handshake (70-80% detection rate)
- **OS Fingerprinting:** 2000+ signatures using 16-probe technique
- **High Performance:** Asynchronous I/O with lock-free coordination
- **Cross-Platform:** Linux, Windows, macOS support
- **Multiple Interfaces:** CLI (v1.0), TUI (planned), Web UI (planned), GUI (planned)

### Introduction

**ProRT-IP WarScan** (Protocol/Port Real-Time IP War Scanner) is a modern equivalent of classic 1980s/1990s war dialers—reimagined for IP networks. Where tools like ToneLoc and THC-Scan systematically dialed phone numbers to find modems/BBSs, WarScan systematically scans IP address ranges, ports, and protocols to discover active hosts and services.

WarScan consolidates and advances the best of today's network scanning and analysis tools, delivering a comprehensive, high-performance, stealth-focused toolkit for penetration testers and red teams. It is implemented in **Rust** for safety and performance, initially released as a **CLI** utility (`prtip`), with a roadmap for **TUI**, **web**, and **desktop GUI** interfaces.

**Key goals and characteristics:**

- **Extensive multi-layer scanning:** From host discovery (ARP/ICMP) up through TCP/UDP scans and application-layer banner grabbing
- **High performance & efficiency:** Internet-scale scanning inspired by the fastest modern scanners (1M+ packets/second stateless)
- **Advanced red-team features:** Stealth techniques (randomization, timing dithering, decoys, fragmentation, idle scans) to evade detection
- **Cross-platform & extensible:** Linux-first with Windows/macOS support via Rust portability; open-source (GPLv3)
- **Future UI enhancements:** TUI → web → GUI, expanding accessibility without sacrificing power

**In summary**, WarScan aims to be a one-stop, modern war-scanning solution—combining the thoroughness of classic mappers, the speed of internet-scale scanners, the usability of friendly GUIs, the deep packet insight of protocol analyzers, and the raw versatility of low-level network tools.

### Inspiration from Existing Tools

To design WarScan, we surveyed state-of-the-art tools widely used for networking, penetration testing, and packet analysis. Each contributes valuable features and lessons:

- **Nmap (Network Mapper):** The gold standard for discovery, versatile port scan techniques, service/version detection, OS fingerprinting, a powerful scripting engine, and numerous stealth/evasion capabilities. WarScan incorporates multiple scan types (connect, SYN, FIN/NULL/Xmas, UDP), service/OS detection, and similar evasion features in a modernized implementation.

- **Masscan:** Ultra high-speed, asynchronous/stateless internet-scale scanning at extreme packet rates. WarScan borrows the speed/scalability model—highly parallelized, stateless fast modes—then enables deeper follow-up scans on responders.

- **ZMap:** Internet-scale, single-packet rapid scans across huge IP ranges. WarScan includes a comparable "fast scan mode" for breadth-first discovery followed by depth on responsive hosts.

- **RustScan:** Demonstrates Rust's advantages: fast full-port sweeps, adaptive performance learning, and extensibility/scripting. WarScan mirrors this split-phase strategy (fast discovery → detailed enumeration) and evaluates an embedded scripting layer.

- **Unicornscan:** Pioneered asynchronous/stateless techniques and userland TCP/IP stack control for advanced packet crafting, banner grabbing, protocol-specific UDP probes, and OS/app fingerprinting. WarScan builds similar packet-crafting flexibility and export to PCAP/DB.

- **Wireshark:** The model for protocol depth and parsing. WarScan parses responses (e.g., HTTP headers, TLS certs), logs to PCAP, and emphasizes robust protocol coverage.

- **Angry IP Scanner:** Highlights usability, speed via multithreading, cross-platform reach, simple exports, and plugins. WarScan's roadmap includes a friendly TUI/GUI and enriched host info (reverse DNS, ARP/MAC/vendor, NetBIOS/mDNS where possible).

- **Netcat/Ncat:** The "Swiss Army knife" for quick banner grabs and interactive tests. WarScan supports custom payloads and optional interactive follow-ups to validate findings.

## Nmap Compatibility 🔄

**ProRT-IP v0.3.5+** supports nmap-style command-line syntax for familiar operation. All existing ProRT-IP flags continue to work - nmap flags are added as convenient aliases.

### Why Nmap Compatibility?

- **Familiar Syntax:** Use nmap commands you already know
- **Drop-in Replacement:** Many nmap commands work as-is
- **Zero Learning Curve:** For nmap users, start scanning immediately
- **Backward Compatible:** All original ProRT-IP flags still supported

### Quick Examples

```bash
# These work identically:
prtip -sS -p 80,443 192.168.1.0/24           # Nmap syntax
prtip -s syn --ports 80,443 192.168.1.0/24   # ProRT-IP syntax

# Fast scanning
prtip -F 192.168.1.1                         # Top 100 ports (nmap -F)
prtip --top-ports 50 192.168.1.1             # Top 50 ports

# Output formats
prtip -p 22 192.168.1.1 -oN scan.txt         # Normal text (nmap -oN)
prtip -p 22 192.168.1.1 -oX scan.xml         # XML format (nmap -oX)
prtip -p 22 192.168.1.1 -oG scan.gnmap       # Greppable (nmap -oG)

# Aggressive scanning
prtip -A -p 80,443 target.com                # OS + service detection (nmap -A)
```

### Compatibility Status

**✅ Fully Compatible (v0.3.5):**

- All core scan types (`-sS`, `-sT`, `-sU`, `-sN`, `-sF`, `-sX`, `-sA`)
- Port specifications (`-p`, `-F`, `--top-ports`)
- Output formats (`-oN`, `-oX`, `-oG`)
- Detection modes (`-sV`, `-O`, `-A`)
- Verbosity levels (`-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`)
- Timing templates (`-T0` through `-T5`)

**⏳ Planned (Future Releases):**

- `--traceroute` - Route tracing (Phase 5)
- `-6` - IPv6 support (Phase 5)
- `-f`, `-mtu` - Packet fragmentation (Phase 5)
- Idle/zombie scanning (Phase 5)

### Performance Comparison

ProRT-IP maintains significant speed advantages while supporting nmap syntax:

| Scan Type | Nmap | ProRT-IP | Speedup |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| 1K ports (local) | 3.2s | 66ms | **48x faster** |
| Service detection | 8.1s | 2.3s | **3.5x faster** |
| OS fingerprinting | 5.4s | 1.8s | **3x faster** |
| Full port scan (all 65535) | ~18min | ~3-5min | **3-6x faster** |

### Migration Guide

#### For Nmap Users

Most nmap commands work as-is. Key differences:

```bash
# Nmap default: SYN scan if root, Connect otherwise
# ProRT-IP: Connect scan by default (safer)
# To match nmap behavior exactly:
sudo prtip -sS ...   # Requires privileges like nmap

# Nmap default: Top 1000 ports
# ProRT-IP: Top 100 ports (faster)
# To match nmap behavior:
prtip --top-ports 1000 ...
```

#### For ProRT-IP Users

All existing commands continue to work. Nmap syntax is optional:

```bash
# Original ProRT-IP syntax (still works)
prtip -s syn --ports 1-1000 --output json target.com

# New nmap syntax (also works)
prtip -sS -p 1-1000 -oX scan.xml target.com

# Mix both (totally fine!)
prtip -sS --ports 1-1000 -oX scan.xml target.com
```

### Full Documentation

See [docs/NMAP_COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/NMAP_COMPATIBILITY.md) for:

- Complete flag compatibility matrix
- Behavioral differences from nmap
- Advanced usage examples
- Migration strategies
- Future roadmap

### Testing Nmap Compatibility

Run the integration test suite:

```bash
# From project root
./scripts/test-nmap-compat.sh
```

Or compare directly with nmap:

```bash
# Same command, different scanner
nmap -sS -p 80,443 target.com
prtip -sS -p 80,443 target.com
```
