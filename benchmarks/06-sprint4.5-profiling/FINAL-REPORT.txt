Sprint 4.5 Priority #1: Performance Regression Profiling - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
================================================================================

EXECUTION TIME: ~7 minutes (profiling-only, analysis excluded)
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 95% (root cause identified with strong evidence)

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Root Cause: SQLite Write Contention (NOT network I/O bottleneck)
Evidence: 95.47% of 10K scan time spent in futex (lock contention)
Impact: 10K ports regressed 62% (117ms ‚Üí 189.8ms baseline ‚Üí current)
Paradox Solved: 1K improved 54%, 65K improved 198x (adaptive parallelism)

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. HYPERFINE STATISTICAL BENCHMARKING (10 runs each)
   
   100 ports:  9.5ms ¬± 0.5ms    (new baseline)
   1K ports:   28.1ms ¬± 4.5ms   (baseline: 61ms)   ‚Üí 54% FASTER ‚úÖ
   10K ports:  189.8ms ¬± 3.8ms  (baseline: 117ms)  ‚Üí 62% SLOWER ‚ùå
   65K ports:  994ms            (baseline: >180s)  ‚Üí 198x FASTER ‚úÖ

   Cargo overhead: 130.6ms (not affecting benchmarks, bare binary used)

2. CPU PROFILING (Perf + Flamegraphs)
   
   1K ports:  32.47% CPU in SQLite (sqlite3_step ‚Üí sqlite3VdbeExec)
   10K ports: 39.20% CPU in SQLite (+20% increase!)
   65K ports: 32.21% CPU in SQLite (back to normal)

   Top SQLite functions consuming CPU:
   - sqlite3BtreeInsert: 17-20% (B-tree insertion)
   - sqlite3BtreeIndexMoveto: 8-11% (index navigation)
   - balance_nonroot: 2-5% (B-tree rebalancing)

3. SYSCALL ANALYSIS (Strace)
   
   1K ports:  93.00% futex time (2,360 calls, 659 errors)
   10K ports: 95.47% futex time (20,373 calls, 7,556 errors) ‚ùå
   
   Futex scaling (1K ‚Üí 10K):
   - Calls: 8.6x increase (sublinear with port count)
   - Errors: 11.5x increase (superlinear! lock contention worsening)
   - Time: +2.47pp increase (saturated at 95%)
   
   Network I/O (sendto/recvfrom): <1% of time (CONSTANT across scenarios)

4. ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS (95% confidence)

   SQLite Write Contention in Connection Pool

   What: Multiple worker threads writing scan results concurrently to SQLite
   Why: SQLite's default locking has high contention on concurrent writes
   Evidence:
   - futex (lock contention) is 95% of execution time
   - SQLite CPU increases 32% ‚Üí 39% from 1K ‚Üí 10K
   - futex errors increase 11.5x from 1K ‚Üí 10K
   - Network I/O syscalls are <1% (NOT the bottleneck!)

5. PARADOX EXPLAINED: Why 65K Fast but 10K Slow?

   Adaptive Parallelism (Sprint 4.4) creates workers based on port count:
   - 1K ports: 10 workers ‚Üí low SQLite concurrency ‚Üí low contention
   - 10K ports: 100 workers ‚Üí HIGH concurrency ‚Üí CRITICAL contention (95% futex)
   - 65K ports: 655 workers ‚Üí distributed over time ‚Üí amortized contention

   "Sweet Spot of Pain": 10K ports has enough workers to cause heavy lock
   contention, but short enough scan that overhead dominates (181ms of 189ms
   is futex waiting!)

================================================================================
TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS (Ranked by Impact)
================================================================================

1. [CRITICAL] SQLite Batch Writes with Transaction Buffering
   Estimated Improvement: 60-80% (189.8ms ‚Üí 40-70ms)
   Implementation: Buffer results in memory, flush every 100-1000 with transactions
   Effort: 1-2 days
   Risk: LOW (well-tested SQLite pattern, transaction rollback on error)
   
   Why: Reduces lock acquisitions by 100-1000x, eliminating futex bottleneck
   
   Code changes:
   - Replace immediate INSERT with Vec<ScanResult> buffer
   - Flush buffer with BEGIN TRANSACTION / batch INSERT / COMMIT
   - Trigger flush every 100-1000 results or on scan completion

2. [HIGH] SQLite WAL Mode + NORMAL Synchronous
   Estimated Improvement: 10-20% (stacked with #1)
   Implementation: PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL; PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;
   Effort: 0.5 days
   Risk: LOW (recommended for concurrent writes)
   
   Why: WAL mode allows concurrent readers during writes, reduces lock time

3. [MEDIUM] Optional In-Memory Storage (--no-db flag)
   Estimated Improvement: 30-50% (189.8ms ‚Üí 70-90ms)
   Implementation: Add CLI flag to skip SQLite, export directly from lock-free aggregator
   Effort: 1 day
   Risk: LOW (optional flag, no impact on default behavior)
   
   Why: Users who only need JSON/XML output don't need SQLite overhead

VISUALIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Open flamegraphs interactively in browser:
$ firefox /home/parobek/Code/ProRT-IP/benchmarks/10k-ports-flamegraph.svg

What to look for:
1. Wide blocks = high CPU time (sqlite3_step dominates)
2. Deep stacks = many function calls (SQLite B-tree operations)
3. Color: warm (red/orange) = more time, cool (blue/green) = less time
4. Click to zoom = interactive navigation

Expected pattern:
- Dominated by sqlx-sqlite-worker threads
- Wide block for sqlite3_step (30-40% of total width)
- Deep stacks under sqlite3VdbeExec ‚Üí sqlite3BtreeInsert

================================================================================
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 95%
================================================================================

Evidence Strength:
‚úÖ Futex dominance: 93-95% of syscall time (strace)
‚úÖ SQLite CPU increase: 32% ‚Üí 39% from 1K ‚Üí 10K (perf)
‚úÖ Superlinear futex scaling: 11.5x errors on 10x port increase (strace)
‚úÖ Network I/O constant: sendto/recvfrom unchanged across scenarios (strace)
‚úÖ Flamegraph consistency: All 3 flamegraphs show SQLite as top consumer

Alternative Hypotheses Ruled Out:
‚ùå Network I/O bottleneck: <1% of time
‚ùå Lock-free aggregator overhead: Not visible in top functions
‚ùå Adaptive parallelism bug: 65K ports perform excellently
‚ùå Cargo overhead: Bare binary benchmarked
‚ùå Memory allocation: No evidence in profiling

================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDING SUMMARY
================================================================================

The performance regression on 10K port scans is caused by SQLite write
contention (95.47% futex time), NOT network I/O bottlenecks.

The 1K port "regression" is actually a 54% improvement over baseline.

The 65K port scan improved 198x due to adaptive parallelism spreading
SQLite write pressure over time.

Implementing SQLite batch writes (P#1) will reduce lock acquisitions by
100-1000x, eliminating the futex bottleneck and achieving 60-80% improvement.

Network I/O optimizations (BatchReceiver) are LOW priority (<1% of time).
