# Sprint 4.8 v2 Performance Results

## Before (Sprint 4.7)
- Default: 39.2ms ± 3.7ms
- --with-db: 139.9ms ± 4.4ms (BROKEN - async not working)
- Overhead: 100.7ms (257% slower!)

## After (Sprint 4.8 v2)
- Default: 41.1ms ± 3.5ms
- --with-db: 74.5ms ± 8.0ms
- Overhead: 33.4ms (81% slower)

## Improvement
- Default: -1.9ms (4.8% slower, within noise margin)
- --with-db: -65.4ms (46.7% faster!)
- Overhead reduction: -67.3ms (67% improvement!)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Default ~41ms (maintained, within 5% of baseline)
- ⚠️ --with-db 74.5ms (target was <45ms, achieved 47% improvement)
- ✅ All tests passing without hangs (620 tests, 100% pass rate)
- ✅ Database verified working (130K results stored correctly)

## Analysis

The async storage implementation is now WORKING correctly:
- No deadlocks (all tests pass)
- True async completion signaling via oneshot channel
- Proper channel lifecycle management with Option<UnboundedSender>

Performance improvement of 46.7% is significant but not meeting the ~40ms target. The 74.5ms
includes both:
1. Scanning overhead: 41.1ms (in-memory)
2. Database overhead: 33.4ms (async writes + SQLite transactions)

The async worker is functioning correctly, but SQLite write performance on localhost loopback
with 10K ports is showing overhead. This is acceptable for production use where the bottleneck
is network latency (scanning 10K ports over network takes ~5-10 seconds, making 74ms negligible).

## Root Cause Analysis (Previous Failure)

**Issue**: tokio::select! with sleep arm prevented `else` branch from triggering
**Fix**: Use timeout() wrapped around recv() to properly detect channel closure
**Result**: Worker now correctly detects when all senders are dropped and completes gracefully

## Key Implementation Details

1. **StorageBackend Changes**:
   - tx: Arc<Mutex<Option<UnboundedSender>>> (allows explicit drop)
   - completion_rx: Arc<Mutex<Option<oneshot::Receiver>>> (signals completion)
   - flush() takes ownership of tx, drops it, awaits completion signal

2. **Worker Changes**:
   - Replaced tokio::select! with timeout() + match
   - Ok(Some(x)) => received data
   - Ok(None) => channel closed, final flush, break
   - Err(_) => timeout, periodic flush

3. **Channel Lifecycle**:
   - Step 1: flush() takes tx ownership via Option::take()
   - Step 2: Explicit drop(tx) signals channel closure
   - Step 3: Worker's recv() returns None
   - Step 4: Worker sends completion via oneshot::Sender
   - Step 5: flush() awaits oneshot::Receiver for true async completion
