# Rust Version Correction

**IMPORTANT CORRECTION:**

The comprehensive report incorrectly stated that the system was running Rust 1.85.0 (a downgrade from 1.90.0). 

**Actual Rust Version:**
- Current: 1.90.0 (2025-09-14)
- Phase 3 Baseline: 1.90.0 (same)
- README Badge: Shows "1.85+" (MSRV - Minimum Supported Rust Version)

**Conclusion:**
- No Rust version downgrade occurred
- Both Phase 3 and Sprint 4.3-4.4 used Rust 1.90.0
- Performance regression is NOT due to Rust version change
- Alternative causes must be investigated:
  1. System state differences (thermal throttling, background processes)
  2. Timing methodology (cargo wrapper vs bare binary)
  3. Lock-free aggregator atomic operation overhead at low scales
  4. Run-to-run variability

**Revised Sprint 4.5 Priority #1:**
- Performance regression investigation should focus on profiling with perf
- Run multiple iterations (5-10) to establish statistical significance
- Test with bare binary (eliminate cargo overhead)
- Profile hot paths with flamegraphs
- Consider that regression may be within acceptable variance

**Note:** The 65K port scan improvement (198x) is still validated and critical.
