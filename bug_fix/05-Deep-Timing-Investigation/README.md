# Deep Timing Investigation (Sprint 4.8)

**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED - No Bug Found
**Investigation Date:** 2025-10-11

## Issue Summary
**Reported:** Perceived 20-30s "hangs" between hosts on network scans
**Investigation Result:** Legitimate TCP timeouts on dead hosts, not a software bug
**Root Cause:** Network behavior (RST delay/timeout) on unreachable hosts
**Solution:** Documentation + user guidance (use T4 timing, discovery workflow)

## Files
- **01-Investigation-Summary.md** - Complete investigation process
- **02-Root-Cause-Analysis.md** - Technical deep-dive into TCP timeout behavior
- **03-No-Bug-Found-Report.md** - Conclusion: Working as designed
- **04-User-Guide-Fix-Slow-Scans.md** - Best practices for faster network scans

## Key Findings
- All operations complete in < 5ms (progress bridge, storage, aggregator)
- Zero blocking operations found in codebase
- "Hangs" are legitimate 3-second TCP timeouts on dead hosts
- Workaround: Use host discovery (-sn) before port scanning, or T4 timing
