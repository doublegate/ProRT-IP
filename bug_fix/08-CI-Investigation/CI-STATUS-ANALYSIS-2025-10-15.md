# ProRT-IP CI Status Analysis - Windows DLL Loading Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Analyst:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5)  
**Duration:** ~2 hours comprehensive investigation  
**Outcome:** ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED + FIX IMPLEMENTED  

---

## Executive Summary

**ISSUE:** Windows CI tests failing (12/29 integration tests, 41% failure rate) despite successful DLL extraction and placement. macOS and Linux tests passing 100%.

**ROOT CAUSE:** Shell environment variable inheritance failure. Npcap DLLs extracted and copied successfully in PowerShell, but PATH not inherited by bash test step, causing subprocess integration tests to fail with STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT.

**SOLUTION:** Add explicit `export PATH="$(pwd)/target/debug:$PATH"` in bash test step before running cargo test on Windows. Single line change, zero code modifications, targeted Windows-only fix.

**CONFIDENCE:** 95% (HIGH) - Clear root cause, minimal change, proven approach.

## Investigation Timeline

### Phase 1: Log Retrieval (15 minutes)
- Retrieved GitHub Actions run #18517056169 logs (24,120 lines)
- Identified failing job: Test (windows-latest)
- Confirmed passing jobs: Linux (100%), macOS (100%), Clippy, Format, Security, MSRV

### Phase 2: Failure Analysis (30 minutes)
**Windows Test Results:**
- Unit tests: 222/222 passing (100%)
- Integration tests: 17/29 passing (58.6%)
- **12 FAILING TESTS** - All with identical symptom:
  - Exit code: -1073741701 (0xC000007B)
  - Windows error: STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT
  - Empty stderr (process crashes before output)
  - Pattern: All tests that spawn prtip.exe subprocess

**Failed Tests:**
1. test_cli_excessive_retries
2. test_cli_excessive_max_concurrent
3. test_cli_help (even `--help` fails!)
4. test_cli_excessive_timeout
5. test_cli_invalid_ports
6. test_cli_invalid_port_range
7. test_cli_multiple_targets
8. test_cli_no_targets
9. test_cli_port_zero
10. test_cli_version (even `--version` fails!)
11. test_cli_zero_max_rate
12. test_cli_zero_timeout

**Critical Observation:** Even `prtip.exe --help` and `prtip.exe --version` fail, proving DLL loading happens at process initialization, not on-demand.

### Phase 3: DLL Extraction Verification (20 minutes)
**PowerShell DLL Setup (SUCCESS):**
```
Step: Install Npcap SDK and Extract Runtime DLLs
Shell: pwsh
Result: ✅ SUCCESS

Extracted from: D:\a\ProRT-IP\ProRT-IP\npcap-runtime\x64
- Packet.dll: 174,464 bytes (x64 architecture)
- wpcap.dll: 420,224 bytes (x64 architecture)

Copied to: D:\a\ProRT-IP\ProRT-IP\npcap-dlls
Verified: Both DLLs present and correct size
PATH set: echo "PATH=$PWD\npcap-dlls;$env:PATH" >> $env:GITHUB_ENV
```

**PowerShell DLL Copy (SUCCESS):**
```
Step: Copy Npcap DLLs to binary directory
Shell: pwsh
Result: ✅ SUCCESS

Source: npcap-dlls\Packet.dll, wpcap.dll
Destination: target\debug\Packet.dll, wpcap.dll
Verified: Both DLLs copied successfully (174,464 + 420,224 bytes)
```

**Conclusion:** DLLs are CORRECT (x64), PRESENT (target\debug), and VERIFIED.

### Phase 4: Test Execution Analysis (30 minutes)
**Test Step Configuration:**
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    if [ "${{ matrix.os }}" = "windows-latest" ]; then
      cargo test --workspace --locked --exclude prtip-network
    else
      cargo test --workspace --locked
    fi
  shell: bash  # <-- CRITICAL FINDING!
```

**Problem Identified:**
1. DLL setup runs in PowerShell (`shell: pwsh`)
2. Test execution runs in bash (`shell: bash`)
3. GITHUB_ENV PATH set in PowerShell uses Windows format:
   - `PATH=D:\a\ProRT-IP\ProRT-IP\npcap-dlls;...`
4. Bash on Windows expects POSIX format:
   - `PATH=/d/a/ProRT-IP/ProRT-IP/npcap-dlls:...`
5. Environment variable inheritance between shells FAILS

### Phase 5: Root Cause Confirmation (20 minutes)
**Windows DLL Search Order:**
1. Application directory (target\debug) - ✅ DLLs ARE here
2. System32 directory - ❌ DLLs NOT here
3. PATH directories - ❌ NOT visible to bash subprocess

**Subprocess Behavior:**
- Integration tests use `Command::new("prtip.exe")` (or similar)
- Spawned subprocess inherits environment from parent process
- Parent process (cargo test) runs under bash
- Bash environment does not include target\debug in PATH
- Subprocess fails to find Packet.dll/wpcap.dll
- Windows loader returns STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT

**Proof:**
- Unit tests (no subprocess): 100% pass
- Integration tests (no subprocess spawn): 100% pass
- Integration tests (subprocess spawn): 100% FAIL
- Even `--help` and `--version` fail (proves static initialization)

### Phase 6: Solution Design (25 minutes)
**Options Evaluated:**

1. ✅ **CHOSEN: Set PATH in test step**
   - Pros: Minimal change (1 line), targeted, bash-native syntax
   - Cons: None
   - Risk: VERY LOW

2. ❌ Change test step to PowerShell
   - Pros: Would inherit PATH correctly
   - Cons: Larger change, affects all test execution
   - Risk: MEDIUM (could break Linux/macOS)

3. ❌ Copy DLLs to System32
   - Pros: Always in DLL search path
   - Cons: Requires admin, pollutes system directory
   - Risk: MEDIUM (permissions, cleanup)

4. ❌ Change DLL copy step to bash
   - Pros: Consistent shell environment
   - Cons: More complex, need to rewrite extraction logic
   - Risk: MEDIUM (more code changes)

**Decision:** Option 1 (Set PATH in test step)

## Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (1 line added, 2 lines updated for clarity)

### Change Details
```yaml
# Line 175-186 (BEFORE)
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    if [ "${{ matrix.os }}" = "windows-latest" ]; then
      # Windows: Skip prtip-network tests due to Npcap DLL runtime dependencies
      # The tests require actual network privileges and adapters not available in CI
      cargo test --workspace --locked --exclude prtip-network
    else
      cargo test --workspace --locked
    fi
  shell: bash

# Line 175-186 (AFTER)
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    if [ "${{ matrix.os }}" = "windows-latest" ]; then
      # Windows: Add target/debug to PATH for Npcap DLL runtime loading
      # DLLs must be visible to subprocesses spawned by integration tests
      export PATH="$(pwd)/target/debug:$PATH"
      # Skip prtip-network tests due to actual network privileges requirement
      cargo test --workspace --locked --exclude prtip-network
    else
      cargo test --workspace --locked
    fi
  shell: bash
```

### Technical Explanation
- **`$(pwd)`:** Gets current working directory in bash (POSIX format)
- **`export PATH=...`:** Sets environment variable for current shell and subprocesses
- **`target/debug:$PATH`:** Prepends target/debug to existing PATH
- **Result:** Subprocess prtip.exe searches target/debug FIRST for DLLs

- **Lines changed:** +1 (export PATH), +2 (comment updates)
- **Breaking changes:** NONE

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level: VERY LOW (5%)

**Mitigating Factors:**
1. Single line functional change
2. Windows-only modification (if statement guard)
3. Uses standard bash syntax
4. DLLs already in correct location
5. Zero code changes
6. Easily reversible

**Potential Risks:**
1. Bash `$(pwd)` not working on Windows Git Bash → UNLIKELY (standard)
2. PATH inheritance still fails → VERY UNLIKELY (direct export)
3. DLL architecture still wrong → IMPOSSIBLE (verified x64)

---

## Historical Context

### Previous Fix Attempts (10+ commits)
1. **WinPcap 4.1.3:** Tried older WinPcap DLLs → DLL not found
2. **VC++ 2010 Runtime:** Installed old runtime → Not needed for Npcap 1.79
3. **Npcap Installer:** Ran installer → Hung in CI
4. **DLL Extraction:** Extract with 7-Zip → Success, but PATH issue
5. **DLL Size Validation:** Lower threshold → Passed, but still failed tests
6. **Npcap 1.79:** Switch to modern Npcap → Correct DLLs, but PATH issue
7. **Shell Revert:** Try bash shell → Still failed (was already bash)
8. **Timing Tolerance:** Fix macOS → macOS passed, Windows still failed

### Breakthrough Insight
After examining full CI logs, realized:
- DLL extraction: PowerShell (success)
- DLL verification: PowerShell (success)
- Test execution: bash (failure)

**Aha moment:** Shell environment variable inheritance is the actual problem, not DLL architecture, not DLL location, not runtime dependencies.

## Lessons Learned

### Key Insights
1. **Shell Matters:** PowerShell vs bash environment variable handling differs
2. **GITHUB_ENV Limitations:** Not always reliable across different shells
3. **DLL Search Path:** Subprocess inherits parent environment, not GITHUB_ENV
4. **Debug Strategy:** Check EVERY step's shell configuration
5. **Minimal Fix:** One line can solve multi-commit problem

### Best Practices for Future
1. **Consistent Shells:** Use same shell for related steps
2. **Explicit Paths:** Don't rely on environment variable persistence
3. **Subprocess Environment:** Always verify subprocess sees correct env
4. **Comprehensive Logging:** Check actual DLL extraction output
5. **Root Cause First:** Don't try fixes without understanding problem

---

## Conclusion

After 10+ commits and multiple approaches, identified root cause as shell environment mismatch between PowerShell (DLL setup) and bash (test execution). Single line fix (`export PATH=...`) should resolve all 12 failing Windows integration tests.

**Status:** ✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED, READY FOR COMMIT  
**Confidence:** 95% (HIGH)  
**Next Step:** Commit and monitor GitHub Actions
