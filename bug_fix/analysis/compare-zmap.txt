Oct 11 03:09:30.807 [INFO] zmap: By default, ZMap will output the unique IP addresses of hosts that respond successfully (e.g., SYN-ACK packet). This is equivalent to running ZMap with the following flags: --output-module=csv --output-fields=saddr --output-filter='success=1 && repeat=0' --no-header-row. If you want all responses, explicitly set an output module or set --output-filter="".
Oct 11 03:09:30.807 [WARN] blocklist: ZMap is currently using the default blocklist located at /etc/zmap/blocklist.conf. By default, this blocklist excludes locally scoped networks (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.1/8, and 192.168.0.0/16). If you are trying to scan local networks, you can change the default blocklist by editing the default ZMap configuration at /etc/zmap/blocklist.conf. If you have modified the default blocklist, you can ignore this message.
