## Appendix B: Performance Benchmarks

### B.1 Current Performance (v0.3.7)

**Test Environment:**
- Hardware: Intel i9-10850K (10 cores, 20 threads @ 3.6-5.1GHz), 62GB RAM
- OS: Linux 6.17.1-2-cachyos
- Network: Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps)
- Rust: 1.90.0

**Benchmark Results (v0.3.7 Baseline):**

| Benchmark | Mean Time | Std Dev | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Binary Startup | 2.2ms | ±0.1ms | Fast cold start |
| Port Range Parsing (1-1000) | 1.8ns | ±0.05ns | Zero-copy parsing |
| Port Range Parsing (1-65535) | 1.9ns | ±0.06ns | O(1) complexity |
| Localhost Scan (Connect, 10 ports) | 5.3ms | ±0.4ms | Minimal overhead |
| Localhost Scan (SYN, 100 ports) | 66ms | ±3ms | **Fast common port scan** |
| Output Format (JSON, 1000 results) | 15ms | ±1ms | Efficient serialization |
| Output Format (XML, 1000 results) | 22ms | ±2ms | Serde_xml overhead |

**Real-World Scans:**

| Scenario | ProRT-IP | Nmap | Speedup | Notes |
|----------|----------|------|---------|-------|
| Common Ports (top 100) | 66ms | 150ms | **2.3x faster** | Typical quick scan |
| Single Host (1-1000 ports) | 450ms | 800ms | **1.8x faster** | Connect scan |
| Class C Network (192.168.1.0/24, 80,443) | 2.1s | 5.8s | **2.8x faster** | SYN scan, 2 ports × 256 hosts |
| Large Network (10.0.0.0/16, 22,80,443) | 47s | Unknown | N/A | 3 ports × 65,536 hosts, adaptive rate |

**Comparison vs Competitors:**

| Tool | Common Ports (100) | Full Scan (65K) | Theoretical Max pps | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **ProRT-IP (v0.3.7)** | **66ms** | Unknown | **1M+ (claimed)** | Balanced, network-friendly |
| Nmap | 150ms | 17 minutes | 100K | Comprehensive but slow |
| Masscan | 50ms | 5 minutes | 10M+ | Ultra-fast, stateless |
| RustScan | 223ms | 3-8 seconds | Unknown | Fast discovery + Nmap depth |
| Naabu | 2335ms | Unknown | Unknown | Slowest in common port test |

**Key Insights:**
- ProRT-IP is **2.3x faster** than Nmap for common ports (66ms vs 150ms) - validated
- Masscan is fastest (50ms) but lacks depth (no service detection)
- RustScan claims 3-8 second full scans - ProRT-IP should match this in v0.4.0 (performance sprint 4.17)
- ProRT-IP's 1M+ pps claim not yet validated with production workload - Sprint 4.17 goal

### B.2 Projected Performance (v0.4.0)

**After Sprint 4.17 (I/O Optimization):**

**Expected Improvements:**
- **Sendmmsg Batching**: 30-50% reduction in syscall overhead at high packet rates
- **Zero-Copy Parsing**: 10-20% reduction in packet processing latency
- **NUMA Optimization**: 20%+ improvement on multi-socket systems (2+ CPU sockets)

**Projected Benchmarks:**

| Metric | v0.3.7 (Current) | v0.4.0 (Target) | Improvement | Validation Method |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Common Ports (100) | 66ms | <60ms | 10%+ | HyperFine benchmark |
| Full Scan (65K ports) | Unknown | 3-8s | Match RustScan | Real-world test |
| Sustained pps (10GbE) | Unknown | 1M+ | Validate claim | iperf + packet generator |
| CPU @ 1M pps | Unknown | <50% | Efficiency | perf stat during scan |
| Latency p99 | Unknown | <2µs | Low jitter | Packet send latency |

**Performance Validation Plan (Sprint 4.17):**

1. **Throughput Test**: Send 1M packets/second to blackhole (no responses), measure sustained rate
2. **Latency Test**: Measure packet send latency (TSC timestamps), calculate p50/p95/p99
3. **CPU Efficiency**: Profile with `perf stat`, measure cycles per packet
4. **Comparison**: Run side-by-side with Masscan and RustScan on same hardware
5. **Report**: Generate PERFORMANCE-REPORT-v0.4.0.md with validated metrics

**Expected Outcome:**
- ProRT-IP competitive with RustScan for speed (3-8 second full scans)
- Maintains service detection depth (80%+) that RustScan lacks
- Validated as "hybrid scanner": Masscan speed + Nmap depth

### B.3 Memory Efficiency

**Current Memory Usage (v0.3.7):**

| Scan Type | Target Count | Memory Usage | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| TCP Connect | 1,000 hosts × 100 ports | ~15MB | Connection pool overhead |
| TCP SYN | 10,000 hosts × 1,000 ports | ~50MB | Stateful tracking |
| UDP | 256 hosts × 100 ports | ~8MB | Minimal state |
| Service Detection | 1,000 services | +20MB | Probe database + banners |

**Projected Memory Efficiency (Phase 4 Performance Sprints):**
- **Lock-Free Aggregator**: Reduce memory contention, faster result collection
- **Streaming Output**: Write results to disk immediately, avoid memory accumulation
- **Adaptive Parallelism**: Scale concurrency based on available memory

**Masscan Comparison:**
- Masscan: <1MB for arbitrary target count (stateless)
- ProRT-IP: ~50MB for 10M targets (stateful) - acceptable tradeoff for service detection
