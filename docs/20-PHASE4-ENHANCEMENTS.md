## Appendix D: Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Expected Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 2025-10-27 | Sprint prioritization: TUI (5.1) → IPv6 (5.2) → Idle (5.3) → Plugin (5.4) | TUI is quick differentiation win (3-4 days), IPv6 closes major gap, Idle is critical stealth feature, Plugin has highest ROI but longest duration | Balanced approach: quick wins + strategic gaps + high-value features |
| 2025-10-27 | Plugin system: Lua (mlua) instead of multi-language | Nmap's NSE is Lua-based (proven ecosystem), mlua is mature and safe, multi-language adds complexity | Faster implementation, security (sandboxing), ecosystem reuse (Nmap scripts adaptable) |
| 2025-10-27 | IPv6 completion vs new features | IPv6 infrastructure complete (Sprint 4.21), remaining scanners is 80% code reuse, closes major competitive gap | High ROI (8.5/10), straightforward implementation, critical for enterprise adoption |
| 2025-10-27 | Defer SCTP scanning to Phase 6 | SCTP is rare protocol (<1% use cases), low ROI vs Idle scan, no competitors except Nmap support it | Focus on high-impact features first, SCTP can be Phase 6 or community contribution |
| 2025-10-27 | TUI before Web UI | TUI is faster to implement (3-4 days vs 4-6 weeks for Web), provides immediate differentiation, uses existing CLI core | Progressive enhancement strategy: CLI → TUI → Web → GUI |
| 2025-10-27 | Output format expansion low priority | Current formats (JSON, XML, Greppable) cover 80% use cases, scriptable format is niche, low competitive impact | Focus on higher-ROI features (Plugin, Idle scan, TUI) |
| 2025-10-27 | Benchmarking suite medium priority | Performance claims need validation, regression detection critical for CI, but not user-facing feature | Important for engineering quality, secondary to user-facing features |
| 2025-10-27 | Documentation sprint at end (5.8) | Synthesizes all Phase 5 changes, comprehensive update more efficient than incremental, includes marketing content | Cohesive documentation, marketing-ready content, comprehensive release notes |
