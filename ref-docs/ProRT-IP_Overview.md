# ProRT-IP WarScan: Modern IP “War Dialer” and Network Scanner

## Introduction and Overview

**ProRT-IP WarScan** (Protocol/Port Real-Time IP War Scanner) is a modern equivalent of classic 1980s/1990s war dialers—reimagined for IP networks. Where tools like ToneLoc and THC-Scan systematically dialed phone numbers to find modems/BBSs, WarScan systematically scans IP address ranges, ports, and protocols to discover active hosts and services.

WarScan consolidates and advances the best of today’s network scanning and analysis tools, delivering a comprehensive, high-performance, stealth-focused toolkit for penetration testers and red teams. It will be implemented in **Rust** for safety and performance, initially released as a **CLI** utility (`prtip`), with a roadmap for **TUI**, **web**, and **desktop GUI** interfaces.

**Key goals and characteristics:**

* **Extensive multi-layer scanning:** From host discovery (ARP/ICMP) up through TCP/UDP scans and application-layer banner grabbing.
* **High performance & efficiency:** Internet-scale scanning inspired by the fastest modern scanners.
* **Advanced red-team features:** Stealth techniques (randomization, timing dithering, decoys, fragmentation, idle scans) to evade detection.
* **Cross-platform & extensible:** Linux-first with Windows/macOS support via Rust portability; open-source (GPLv3).
* **Future UI enhancements:** TUI → web → GUI, expanding accessibility without sacrificing power.

**In summary**, WarScan aims to be a one-stop, modern war-scanning solution—combining the thoroughness of classic mappers, the speed of internet-scale scanners, the usability of friendly GUIs, the deep packet insight of protocol analyzers, and the raw versatility of low-level network tools. The sections below outline inspirations, planned features and design, and the development strategy.

## Inspiration from Existing Tools and Utilities

To design WarScan, we surveyed state-of-the-art tools widely used for networking, penetration testing, and packet analysis. Each contributes valuable features and lessons:

* **Nmap (Network Mapper):** The gold standard for discovery, versatile port scan techniques, service/version detection, OS fingerprinting, a powerful scripting engine, and numerous stealth/evasion capabilities. WarScan will incorporate multiple scan types (connect, SYN, FIN/NULL/Xmas, UDP), service/OS detection, and similar evasion features in a modernized implementation.

* **Masscan:** Ultra high-speed, asynchronous/stateless internet-scale scanning at extreme packet rates. WarScan borrows the speed/scalability model—highly parallelized, stateless fast modes—then enables deeper follow-up scans on responders.

* **ZMap:** Internet-scale, single-packet rapid scans across huge IP ranges. WarScan includes a comparable “fast scan mode” for breadth-first discovery followed by depth on responsive hosts.

* **RustScan:** Demonstrates Rust’s advantages: fast full-port sweeps, adaptive performance learning, and extensibility/scripting. WarScan mirrors this split-phase strategy (fast discovery → detailed enumeration) and evaluates an embedded scripting layer.

* **Unicornscan:** Pioneered asynchronous/stateless techniques and userland TCP/IP stack control for advanced packet crafting, banner grabbing, protocol-specific UDP probes, and OS/app fingerprinting. WarScan builds similar packet-crafting flexibility and export to PCAP/DB.

* **Wireshark:** The model for protocol depth and parsing. WarScan will parse responses (e.g., HTTP headers, TLS certs), log to PCAP, and emphasize robust protocol coverage.

* **Angry IP Scanner:** Highlights usability, speed via multithreading, cross-platform reach, simple exports, and plugins. WarScan’s roadmap includes a friendly TUI/GUI and enriched host info (reverse DNS, ARP/MAC/vendor, NetBIOS/mDNS where possible).

* **Netcat/Ncat:** The “Swiss Army knife” for quick banner grabs and interactive tests. WarScan will support custom payloads and optional interactive follow-ups to validate findings.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1) Multi-Protocol and Multi-Layer Scanning

* **Host Discovery:** ICMP (echo/timestamp/netmask), TCP SYN/ACK pings, UDP pings to common services, ARP on LAN, and fast “ping sweep” modes.
* **TCP Port Scanning:**

  * Connect scans (OS sockets fallback).
  * SYN (half-open) for stealth.
  * FIN/NULL/Xmas stealth scans.
  * ACK scans for firewall state differentiation.
  * **Custom packet scans:** Arbitrary TCP flag combinations/sequences.
* **UDP Scanning:** Empty and protocol-specific payloads (DNS, SNMP, etc.), interpreting replies/ICMP errors for state; tailored probes to elicit responses.
* **IPv6 Scanning:** Targeted IPv6 support, with proper ICMPv6 discovery.
* **Application-Layer & Service Detection:** Banner grabbing and protocol handshakes (HTTP/SMTP/FTP/SSH/…); library of probe payloads and expected responses; candidate reuse of existing service probe DBs (license permitting).
* **OS Fingerprinting:** Active probes and response analysis against a fingerprint DB to infer OS family/version.
* **Enumerating Network Info (Local Nets):** ARP-derived MAC/vendor, NetBIOS/mDNS names, reverse DNS lookups.

**Outcome:** From “is this IP alive?” to “what service/version on what OS?”, WarScan provides holistic reconnaissance.

### 2) High Performance and Efficiency

* **Asynchronous scanning engine:** Event-driven I/O (e.g., tokio) with stateless modes for extreme throughput.
* **Multi-threaded, multi-core utilization:** Sharded work distribution across CPUs for send/receive/analysis pipelines.
* **Adaptive rate control:** Auto-tune based on loss/latency/timeouts; user caps (e.g., `--max-rate`) to avoid flooding.
* **Efficient resource use:** Memory-safe Rust; lock-free queues/atomics where beneficial; careful socket/FD management.
* **Internet-scale readiness:** Feasible IPv4-wide sweeps for specific ports with safety controls and explicit confirmations.
* **Parallel target sharding & randomization:** Configurable host group sizes, randomized ordering by default, and optional distributed coordination in future releases.

### 3) Stealth, Evasion, and Red-Team Features

* **Randomized scan order:** Shuffle targets/ports to disrupt sequential detection heuristics.
* **Timing flexibility & slow modes:** Templates (`T0`…`T5`), jitter/dither, `--scan-delay`, `--max-rate` for fine control.
* **Packet fragmentation:** Split probes to evade naive filters; configurable fragment size/MTU.
* **Source spoofing & decoys:** Decoy lists and spoofed sources; random decoy generation with operational caveats.
* **Idle (zombie) scanning:** Automated or user-specified zombies with predictable IPID behaviors.
* **Custom source ports & protocol crafting:** Blend-in probes (e.g., source port 53/80), SYN+ACK pings, and mimicry.
* **Proxies/relays (future):** SOCKS/HTTP proxies, SSH tunnels; optional use of external scan intel as “out-of-band” discovery.

### 4) Extensibility and Automation

* **Scripting engine & plugins:** Embedded Lua/Python (TBD) for post-discovery checks and custom logic (e.g., quick vuln probes, notifications).
* **Modular architecture:** Discrete modules for TCP/UDP/host discovery/OS detection; add new protocols (QUIC/SCTP) without core rewrites.
* **Output & integrations:** Text/JSON/XML; compatibility with common formats; direct DB export (SQLite/PostgreSQL); real-time progress stats.
* **Community:** GPLv3 to foster shared fingerprints, scripts, modules, and distro integration.

### 5) User Interface and Usability

* **CLI (v1.0):** Foundation with structured flags/profiles and comprehensive help.
  Example:

  ```bash
  prtip -sS -p 1-1000 -O -D RND:5 --output=json 10.0.0.0/24
  ```

* **TUI:** Interactive curses-style dashboard for configuring scans and monitoring results in real time.
* **Web interface:** Optional local dashboard with authentication, charts/tables/topology views.
* **Desktop GUI:** Cross-platform GUI (native toolkit or web-wrapper) akin to Zenmap/Angry IP, built atop the same core.

**Usability niceties:** preset profiles (Quick/Full/Stealth), colorized terminal output, audit logging of commands/settings, and an optional interactive CLI shell.

### 6) Cross-Platform Support

* **Windows:** Raw packet features via Npcap/WinPcap; graceful fallbacks to connect scans; native builds.
* **macOS/BSD:** Privileged raw sockets/libpcap nuances handled; tested on common versions.
* **Linux:** Works broadly (Debian/Kali/Ubuntu/Fedora…); optional acceleration (AF_PACKET, PF_RING, DPDK) when available.
* **ARM & others:** Rust portability ensures support for Raspberry Pi/ARM servers; no arch-specific assumptions.
* **Distribution:** Prebuilt binaries, `cargo install prtip`, and optional Docker images.

### 7) Security, Safety, and Optimization in Implementation

* **Memory safety & concurrency:** Rust eliminates common memory errors—vital for privileged, long-running scans.
* **Optimized networking:** Low-overhead raw packet crafting; batched syscalls where available; profiled hot paths.
* **Parallel I/O & capture:** libpcap/OS capture with tight BPF filters; zero-copy parsing where practical; promiscuous mode as needed.
* **Large data handling:** Streamed outputs, buffered writes, minimal RAM retention; scalable to tens of thousands of findings.
* **Robust error handling:** Resilient to malformed traffic and network edge cases.
* **Testing & hardening:** Unit/integration tests, protocol parser fuzzing, CI; open-source scrutiny under GPLv3.
