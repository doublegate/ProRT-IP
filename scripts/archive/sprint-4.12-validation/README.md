## Why Archived?

These scripts were created during Sprint 4.12 to validate a specific bug fix for progress bar incremental updates. The bug has been resolved and the functionality is now covered by comprehensive integration tests.

## Historical Context

**Sprint 4.12 Issue:** Progress bar would jump to 100% immediately instead of showing incremental updates.

**Root Cause:** Port count initialization issue causing instant completion.

**Fix:** Proper port count tracking with incremental updates.

**Verification:** All three scripts confirmed the fix worked correctly.

## Current Testing

Progress bar functionality is now tested via:
- Unit tests in `crates/prtip-cli/tests/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Manual testing via `prtip --progress` flag
