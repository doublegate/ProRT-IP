# ProRT-IP v0.4.0 Phase 4 Completion TODO List

**Created:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** Pending

This document outlines the remaining tasks required to bring Phase 4 to full completion and alignment with the project's documentation, cross-referencing the v0.4.0 Development Plan, existing TODO lists, and compliance audits.

## Executive Summary

While the `v0.4.0-DEVELOPMENT-PLAN.md` outlines a comprehensive strategy for Phase 4 completion and marks all its internal sprints as theoretically complete, the `v0.4.0-TODO-LIST.md` indicates that all tasks within these sprints are still pending. Furthermore, `docs/15-PHASE4-COMPLIANCE.md` and `v0.4.0-COMPLETION-TODO.md` highlight additional critical issues and documentation inconsistencies that need addressing. This consolidated list serves as the definitive guide for achieving full Phase 4 completion for the v0.4.0 release.

## Phase 4 Completion Tasks (High-Level)

### 1. Service Detection Fix (CRITICAL)
- **Issue:** Service detection is not working as expected. The `metasploitable-test-report.md` shows a 14.3% detection rate (1/7 services).
- **Task:** Investigate the root cause of the low detection rate and fix it.
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours
- **Status:** [ ] Pending

### 2. Documentation Cleanup
- **Issue:** There are inconsistencies in the documentation regarding version numbers, dates, and test counts across various files.
- **Task:** Audit all documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/`, `ref-docs/`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, etc.) and fix the inconsistencies. This includes:
    - Updating version references (e.g., v0.3.0 to v0.3.5/v0.4.0).
    - Correcting phase status (e.g., Phase 3 COMPLETE to Phase 4 COMPLETE).
    - Verifying and updating test counts (e.g., 677 tests vs. 421 annotations).
    - Fixing date references.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours
- **Status:** [ ] Pending

### 3. Phase 4 Compliance Gaps (Review and Plan for Phase 5+)
- **Issue:** `docs/15-PHASE4-COMPLIANCE.md` identifies several missing or partial implementations within the original Phase 4 scope that were deferred.
- **Task:** Review these items and create a formal plan for addressing them in Phase 5 or later. This includes:
    - **Stateless 1M+ pps:** Currently partial (SYN scan works, target not reached).
    - **NUMA-aware scheduling:** Not Implemented.
    - **eBPF/XDP bypass:** Not Implemented.
    - **Profiling integration:** Currently manual (perf/flamegraph).
    - **SSL/TLS handshake:** Basic service detection exists, but HTTPS detection needs improvement (target 50%→80% rate).
    - **Greppable output (`-oG`):** Simplified format, needs full Nmap parity.
    - **`-oA` (all outputs):** Partial support, needs simultaneous generation.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 hour (for review and planning)
- **Status:** [ ] Pending

## Documentation Inconsistencies (Immediate Fixes)

These are specific documentation issues identified in `docs/15-PHASE4-COMPLIANCE.md` that need immediate attention for consistency.

- [ ] **NMAP_COMPATIBILITY.md Location Mismatch**
    - **Issue:** Referenced as `docs/NMAP_COMPATIBILITY.md` but may not exist or needs renaming from `docs/14-NMAP-COMPATIBILITY.md`.
    - **Fix:** Verify existence and update all references to the correct path.
- [ ] **Test Count Verification Needed**
    - **Issue:** "677 tests" claimed in various documents, but only 421 `#[test]` annotations were found manually.
    - **Fix:** Run `cargo test --workspace -- --list 2>/dev/null | wc -l` to get an accurate count and update all documentation referencing test counts.
- [ ] **Version References Inconsistent**
    - **Issue:** `ROADMAP.md` still says "v0.3.0" and "2025-10-08" instead of "v0.3.5" and "2025-10-12" (or current v0.4.0 planning dates).
    - **Fix:** Update version and date references in `ROADMAP.md` and other relevant documents.
- [ ] **Phase Status Inconsistent**
    - **Issue:** `ROADMAP.md` line 17 says "Phase 3 COMPLETE" instead of "Phase 4 COMPLETE".
    - **Fix:** Update phase status in `ROADMAP.md` and other relevant documents to reflect Phase 4 completion (or pending completion for v0.4.0).
