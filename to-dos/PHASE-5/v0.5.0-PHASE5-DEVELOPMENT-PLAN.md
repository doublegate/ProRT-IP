## Executive Summary

**Phase 5 Mission:** Achieve feature completeness and production quality for ProRT-IP v0.5.0, delivering Nmap-equivalent capabilities with modern performance, complete IPv6 support, extensibility through plugins, and industry-standard test coverage.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Complete IPv6 Support:** Full scanner integration for SYN, UDP, Stealth, Discovery, Decoy (80% → 100% coverage)
- **Fill Critical Gaps:** Implement Idle scanning for anonymity, missing from v0.4.0
- **Enhance Quality:** Increase code coverage from 62.5% → 80% with comprehensive fuzz testing
- **Enable Extensibility:** Lua plugin system for custom service detection and post-processing
- **Maintain Excellence:** Zero regressions, <5% performance overhead, 100% test pass rate

**Deliverables:**
- **10 core sprints** delivering production-ready features
- **3 optional sprints** for enhanced user experience (defer to v0.6.0 if needed)
- **212+ new tests** (1,338 → 1,550+, +16% growth)
- **5 comprehensive guides** (IPv6, Idle Scan, Plugins, Fuzzing, Benchmarking)
- **8% coverage improvement** (62.5% → 80%)

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks (156-189 hours core development)
**Estimated Effort:**
- **Core:** 156-189 hours (10 sprints)
- **Optional:** 39-56 hours (3 sprints)
- **Total:** 195-245 hours

**Strategic Value:**
Phase 5 positions ProRT-IP as a production-ready Nmap alternative with modern Rust safety, complete IPv6 support for cloud-native environments, extensibility through community plugins, and industry-leading quality metrics. By completing idle scanning, IPv6 integration, and plugin infrastructure, ProRT-IP achieves feature parity with established tools while offering superior performance (1M+ pps), memory safety, and extensibility.

The 80% code coverage target (industry standard for critical security tools) combined with comprehensive fuzz testing ensures production stability. The plugin system opens community contribution pathways, accelerating feature development beyond core team capacity. This phase delivers the foundation for v1.0 release readiness in Phase 7.

**Critical Success Factor:** Prioritizing IPv6 completion (unfinished Phase 4 business) and quality infrastructure (coverage + fuzzing) before plugin system ensures stable foundation for extensibility.

└─ Sprint 5.13: Output Formats Enhancement (12-18h) → Reporting
```

**Rationale for Sequence:**

1. **IPv6 First (Sprint 5.1):** Unfinished business from Phase 4, no dependencies, high strategic value for cloud environments. Completing this early removes technical debt.

2. **Service Detection Second (Sprint 5.2):** Quick win (10-12h), improves reconnaissance quality for subsequent sprints, no dependencies.

3. **Idle Scan Third (Sprint 5.3):** Critical Nmap feature gap, no dependencies, enables anonymity testing. Completing early achieves competitive parity.

4. **Rate Limiting Fourth (Sprint 5.4):** Builds on existing rate limiter, improves stealth and reliability for all subsequent testing.

5. **TLS Analysis Fifth (Sprint 5.5):** Enhances service detection from Sprint 5.2, adds security auditing capability.

6. **Code Coverage Sixth (Sprint 5.6):** Establishes quality foundation before plugin system. Identifies gaps in Sprints 5.1-5.5 for immediate fixes.

7. **Fuzz Testing Seventh (Sprint 5.7):** Security hardening before plugin system. Ensures parsers (including new IPv6/Idle code) are robust.

8. **Plugin System Eighth (Sprint 5.8):** Requires stable API from Sprints 5.1-5.7. Complex (20-25h), deferred until foundation solid.

9. **Benchmarking Ninth (Sprint 5.9):** Validates performance across all new features. Requires all sprints complete for comprehensive baseline.

10. **Documentation Tenth (Sprint 5.10):** Final phase, all features complete. Comprehensive guides for IPv6, Idle, Plugins, Fuzzing, Benchmarking.

**Optional Sprints Deferral:**
- TUI (5.11), CLI Enhancement (5.12), Output Formats (5.13) provide user experience improvements but aren't required for v0.5.0 feature completeness.
- CLI is already mature (50+ flags), current output formats sufficient for pentesting.
- Defer to v0.6.0 focuses Phase 5 on core capabilities (IPv6, Idle, Plugins, Quality).

## Detailed Sprint Plans

### Sprint 5.1: IPv6 Scanner Completion

**Overview:**
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (unfinished Phase 4 business)
- **ROI Score:** 8.5/10 (ENHANCEMENTS) + 6.8/10 (BACKLOG) = HIGH
- **Duration:** 25-30 hours
- **Effort Breakdown:** 5h SYN + 8h UDP/Stealth + 7h Discovery/Decoy + 5h Integration/Docs
- **Dependencies:** NONE (foundation complete in Sprint 4.21)
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM (large scope, but well-defined from BACKLOG)
- **Strategic Value:** Complete dual-stack scanning for cloud-native environments (AWS, GCP, Azure increasingly IPv6-first). Achieves 100% IPv6 coverage (from 30%).

**Rationale:**
IPv6 completion is sequenced first because:
1. Unfinished business from Phase 4 (Sprint 4.21 partial completion)
2. No dependencies on other Phase 5 work (can start immediately)
3. High strategic value: Cloud environments mandate IPv6 support
4. Detailed breakdown already exists in PHASE-5-BACKLOG.md (reduces planning overhead)
5. Removing technical debt early prevents IPv6 complications in later sprints

TCP Connect IPv6 (30% coverage) works for web services, SSH, databases. Remaining scanners (SYN, UDP, Stealth, Discovery, Decoy) cover advanced use cases: stealth scanning, UDP services, host discovery, anonymity techniques.

**Objectives:**
1. Complete IPv6 integration for 5 remaining scanner types (SYN, UDP, Stealth, Discovery, Decoy)
2. Add CLI flags for IPv6 control (-6, -4, --dual-stack)
3. Achieve ≥90% IPv6 scan speed vs IPv4 (minor header parsing overhead acceptable)
4. Create comprehensive IPv6 user guide (800+ lines)

**Tasks (Detailed 4-Phase Breakdown):**

#### Phase 1: SYN Scanner IPv6 (5 hours)

**Objective:** Add IPv6 support to SYN scanner with dual-stack management.

- [ ] **Task 1.1:** Refactor to use `IpAddr` instead of `Ipv4Addr` (2 hours)
  - Update scanner struct fields (`local_ip`, `target_ip`)
  - Update method signatures (send_syn, recv_responses)
  - Update connection tracking (replace `Ipv4Addr` keys with `IpAddr`)
  - Deliverable: `crates/prtip-scanner/src/syn_scanner.rs` (~100 lines modified)

- [ ] **Task 1.2:** Add IPv6 response parsing (1.5 hours)
  - Handle 40-byte IPv6 header (vs 20-byte IPv4)
  - Skip extension headers to find TCP header (Hop-by-Hop, Routing, Fragment, Destination Options)
  - Parse TCP flags from IPv6 packets (SYN-ACK, RST)
  - Deliverable: IPv6 response handler in syn_scanner.rs (~80 lines)

- [ ] **Task 1.3:** Implement dual-stack local IP management (1 hour)
  - Detect local IPv6 addresses (interface enumeration)
  - Select appropriate source IP per target (IPv4 → IPv4 source, IPv6 → IPv6 source)
  - Handle ICMPv6 errors (Type 1: Destination Unreachable)

- IPv6 has no fragmentation in main header (uses extension headers): Different offset calculations
- TCP options parsing same for IPv4/IPv6: Offset differs due to IPv6 header size (40 vs 20 bytes)

**Files to Modify:**
- `crates/prtip-scanner/src/udp_scanner.rs` (~80 lines)
- `crates/prtip-scanner/src/stealth_scanner.rs` (~80 lines)

- IPv6 /64 subnets are standard: 2^64 addresses = massive address space (vs IPv4 /24)
- Decoy addresses must be in same /64: Routing constraint for realistic decoy traffic

**Files to Modify:**
- `crates/prtip-scanner/src/discovery.rs` (~100 lines)
- `crates/prtip-scanner/src/decoy_scanner.rs` (~60 lines)
- `crates/prtip-scanner/tests/test_discovery_ipv6.rs` (NEW, ~140 lines)

- **Performance Tests:** IPv4 vs IPv6 speed comparison (hyperfine benchmark)
- **Cross-Platform:** Linux, Windows, macOS validation (IPv6 stack differences)

**Dependencies & Prerequisites:**

**Requires Completed:**
- Sprint 4.21: IPv6 packet building infrastructure (✅ COMPLETE)
  - ipv6_packet.rs (671 lines, RFC 8200)
  - icmpv6.rs (556 lines, RFC 4443)
  - Ipv6TcpPacketBuilder, Ipv6UdpPacketBuilder
  - TCP Connect IPv6 support (reference implementation)

**Blocks:**
- Sprint 5.6: Code Coverage (benefits from 62 new tests)
- Sprint 5.7: Fuzz Testing (needs IPv6 parsers complete)
- Sprint 5.8: Plugin System (stable API requires IPv6 complete)

**External Dependencies:**
- No new crates required (foundation complete in 4.21)
- **System Requirements:**
  - IPv6 networking enabled on test systems
  - IPv6 connectivity for integration tests (local or internet)
  - ICMPv6 support (ping6 command working)

**Technical Design Notes:**

**High-Level Approach:**
1. **Refactor to IpAddr:** Replace `Ipv4Addr` with `IpAddr` enum throughout scanner code
2. **IPv6 Response Parsing:** Handle 40-byte fixed header + extension headers
3. **Dual-Stack Management:** Auto-detect local IPv4/IPv6, select source IP per target
4. **ICMPv6 Handling:** Map Type 1 codes to scan results (unreachable, admin prohibited, port unreachable)
5. **NDP for Discovery:** Implement Neighbor Solicitation/Advertisement (replaces ARP)

**Architecture Decisions:**
- **IpAddr Enum:** Standard library type supports both IPv4 and IPv6 (no custom types)
- **Extension Headers:** Skip to find TCP/UDP (don't parse all extension types in Phase 5)
- **Dual-Stack Default:** Resolve hostnames to both A and AAAA records (user can override with -4/-6)
- **Performance:** Use IPv6 packet builder from Sprint 4.21 (zero-copy compatible)

**Implementation Patterns:**
- Follow TCP Connect IPv6 pattern from Sprint 4.21b (proven reference)
- Reuse PacketBuffer infrastructure for zero-copy (no regression)
- Maintain timing templates (T0-T5) for IPv6 (same rate limiting)
- Preserve error handling patterns (circuit breaker, retry logic)

**Research References:**
- **RFC 8200:** IPv6 Specification (fixed 40-byte header, extension headers)
- **RFC 4443:** ICMPv6 for IPv6 (Type 1: Destination Unreachable, Type 128/129: Echo)
- **RFC 4861:** Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 (NDP replaces ARP)
- **Nmap IPv6 Support:** https://nmap.org/book/port-scanning-ipv6.html (feature parity reference)
- **pnet crate docs:** IPv6 packet parsing (etherparse alternative)

**Risk Mitigation:**

**Risk:** Sprint 5.1 exceeds 30 hours due to unforeseen IPv6 edge cases
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (large scope, 25-30h is aggressive)
- **Impact:** HIGH (delays all subsequent sprints on critical path)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Budget 35-40 hours contingency (1 extra week)
  - Defer Decoy IPv6 (Phase 3) if timeline slips (lower priority than SYN/UDP)
  - Leverage Sprint 4.21 foundation (30% complete reduces risk)

**Risk:** Performance regression >10% for IPv6 scanning
- **Likelihood:** LOW (header parsing is straightforward, no algorithm changes)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (violates <10% overhead target)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Benchmark after Phase 1 (SYN scanner, early warning)
  - Profile with perf/flamegraph if regression detected
  - Optimize hot paths (extension header skipping)

**Risk:** ICMPv6 parsing bugs cause false positives/negatives
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (complex protocol, 6 Type 1 codes)
- **Impact:** HIGH (incorrect scan results undermine trust)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Comprehensive unit tests for all ICMPv6 codes (Phase 2, Task 2.3)
  - Integration tests with real ICMPv6 traffic (Phase 4, Task 4.7)
  - Reference Nmap behavior for ambiguous cases

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Should --dual-stack be default behavior? (Or require explicit flag?)
  - **Recommendation:** Default to target type (IPv4 → IPv4, IPv6 → IPv6, hostname → A records only). Require --dual-stack for both.
- [ ] How to handle IPv6 /64 scans? (2^64 addresses = 18 quintillion)
  - **Recommendation:** Warn user if range >1M addresses. Suggest sampling or blacklist known-empty ranges.
- [ ] Should we support IPv6 fragmentation extension headers? (Type 44)
  - **Recommendation:** DEFER to Phase 6 (rare in practice, MTU discovery handles most cases).

### Sprint 5.2: Service Detection Enhancement

**Overview:**
- **Priority:** HIGH (quality improvement, quick win)
- **ROI Score:** HIGH (improves reconnaissance quality for all subsequent usage)
- **Duration:** 10-12 hours
- **Effort Breakdown:** 3h HTTP + 2h SSH + 3h SMB + 3h Database + 1h Tests
- **Dependencies:** NONE (independent of Sprint 5.1)
- **Risk Level:** LOW (proven patterns, small scope)
- **Strategic Value:** Increase detection rate from 70-80% to 85-90% (industry-leading). Better reconnaissance results for penetration testers.

**Rationale:**
Service detection enhancement follows IPv6 completion because:
1. Quick win (10-12h) boosts morale after large Sprint 5.1
2. No dependencies, can start immediately after 5.1
3. Improves reconnaissance quality for all future scanning
4. Proven patterns from Phase 3 (extend existing service_db.rs)
5. Sets quality standard before implementing complex features (Idle, Plugins)

Current detection rate (70-80%) is good but not excellent. Nmap achieves ~90% through extensive protocol-specific parsing. This sprint targets 85-90% by adding HTTP header analysis, SSH banner parsing, SMB dialect negotiation, and database handshakes—high-value protocols covering majority of remaining 10-20% gap.

**Objectives:**
1. Increase service detection rate from 70-80% to 85-90% (10-15 percentage point improvement)
2. Add HTTP header fingerprinting (Server, X-Powered-By, X-AspNet-Version)

- **Performance Tests:** Overhead measurement (<10% target)
- **Accuracy Tests:** Detection rate on 100+ service corpus (≥85% target)

**Dependencies & Prerequisites:**

**Requires Completed:**
- Sprint 5.1: IPv6 completion (✅ COMPLETE or in progress)
  - Reason: Enhanced service detection will work on IPv6 targets

**Blocks:**
- Sprint 5.6: Code Coverage (20 tests contribute to coverage improvement)
- Sprint 5.8: Plugin System (enhanced detection provides better baseline for plugin scripts)

**External Dependencies:**
- No new crates required (regex, nom already in dependencies from Phase 3)

**Technical Design Notes:**

**HTTP Fingerprinting:**
- Use existing HTTP parser from banner_grabber.rs (extend, don't rewrite)
- Parse response headers line-by-line (avoid buffering entire response)
- CPE format: `cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.41:*:*:*:*:*:*:*`

**SSH Banner Parsing:**
- Regex pattern: `SSH-(\d+\.\d+)-(\S+)_([\d\.]+)(.*)?`
- Capture groups: protocol, software, version, OS hint
- Example: "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.3" → OpenSSH 8.2p1, Ubuntu

**SMB Dialect Negotiation:**
- Send all dialects (SMB1, SMB 2.002, SMB 2.1, SMB 3.0, SMB 3.02, SMB 3.11)
- Server responds with selected dialect (highest supported)
- Parse SystemTime field from SMB2 Negotiate Response (8 bytes, FILETIME format)
- Map dialect to Windows version (lookup table)

**Database Handshakes:**
- MySQL: Connect, read handshake packet (first packet server sends)
- PostgreSQL: Send StartupMessage, read AuthenticationRequest + ParameterStatus
- Extract version strings, map to product + version

**Research References:**
- **HTTP Headers:** RFC 7231 (HTTP/1.1), common non-standard headers
- **SSH Banner:** RFC 4253 Section 4.2 (SSH Protocol Version Exchange)
- **SMB Dialect:** MS-SMB2 specification (Negotiate Protocol)
- **MySQL Handshake:** MySQL Protocol Documentation (Connection Phase)
- **PostgreSQL Handshake:** PostgreSQL Frontend/Backend Protocol (Startup)

**Risk Mitigation:**

**Risk:** Detection rate <85% on test corpus
- **Likelihood:** LOW (targeted 5 high-value protocols cover most of remaining gap)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (doesn't achieve success criteria)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Measure incrementally: HTTP (3%), SSH (2%), SMB (2%), Databases (3%) = 10% total gain
  - If <85%, add 2-3 more protocols (FTP, SMTP, RDP) in patch release

**Risk:** Protocol parsing bugs cause crashes
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (binary protocols, malformed responses)
- **Impact:** HIGH (undermines stability)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Comprehensive error handling (Result<T, E> for all parsers)
  - Fuzz testing in Sprint 5.7 will catch parser bugs
  - Unit tests with malformed input (Task 2.3, 3.3, 4.5)

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Should we add HTTPS fingerprinting (TLS certificates)? (Or defer to Sprint 5.5?)
  - **Recommendation:** Defer to Sprint 5.5 (TLS Certificate Analysis). Focus 5.2 on application-layer protocols.
- [ ] How to handle version strings without CPE mapping?
  - **Recommendation:** Store raw version string, defer CPE mapping to v0.6.0 (requires CVE database).

### Sprint 5.3: Idle Scan Implementation

**Overview:**
- **Priority:** HIGH (critical Nmap feature gap, competitive parity)
- **ROI Score:** 8.3/10 (ENHANCEMENTS)
- **Duration:** 15-18 hours
- **Effort Breakdown:** 5h Zombie Discovery + 6h ISN Prediction + 4h Scan Logic + 3h Tests
- **Dependencies:** NONE (independent technique)
- **Risk Level:** LOW (well-documented in Nmap, proven technique)
- **Strategic Value:** Enables anonymity for red team operations. ProRT-IP achieves 100% Nmap core feature parity. Fills critical capability gap vs competitors (Masscan, RustScan, Naabu don't support idle scanning).

**Rationale:**
Idle scan (zombie scan) sequenced after service detection because:
1. Critical Nmap feature missing from v0.4.0 (competitive gap)
2. No dependencies (independent scanning technique)
3. Medium complexity (15-18h, well-documented in Salvatore Sanfilippo's paper)
4. High strategic value: Anonymity for penetration testers
5. Completing early achieves full Nmap parity before plugin system

Idle scanning uses a "zombie" host to scan targets without revealing scanner's IP. By measuring IPID (IP Identification field) increments on zombie, scanner infers whether target responded to spoofed SYN. Nmap's most sophisticated stealth technique, essential for attribution evasion in red team scenarios.

**Objectives:**
1. Implement zombie host discovery (find hosts with predictable IPID increments)
2. Create TCP ISN (Initial Sequence Number) prediction engine
3. Build idle scan port prober using SYN/ACK reflection technique

- [ ] Usage examples for zombie discovery and scanning
- [ ] Troubleshooting section for common issues
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry documenting 100% Nmap parity

- **End-to-End Tests:** 2 comprehensive (10 scenarios total)
- **Accuracy Tests:** Compare vs Nmap idle scan (100% match target)
- **Performance Tests:** Zombie discovery (<10s), 1000 ports (<5 minutes)

**Dependencies & Prerequisites:**

**Requires Completed:**
- Phase 2 (TCP packet building): ✅ COMPLETE (Sprint 2.1)
- Raw socket support: ✅ COMPLETE (Phase 1)
- Privilege management: ✅ COMPLETE (Phase 1)

**Blocks:**
- Sprint 5.6: Code Coverage (25 tests contribute to coverage improvement)
- Sprint 5.8: Plugin System (stable idle scan API)

**External Dependencies:**
- No new crates required (pnet for raw sockets already in dependencies)

**Technical Design Notes:**

**Zombie Host Requirements:**
1. **Idle:** Minimal network traffic (predictable IPID)
2. **Sequential IPID:** Increments by 1 per packet (+1, +2, +3, ...)
3. **Reachable:** Responds to SYN/ACK probes (sends RST)
4. **No Firewall:** Allows outbound RST packets

**IPID Increment Patterns:**
- **Sequential:** Linux (kernel <4.18), old Windows (XP/2003) → Good zombie
- **Random:** Modern Linux (kernel 4.18+), modern Windows (10/Server 2016+) → Bad zombie
- **Grouped (per-host):** BSD systems → Bad zombie (separate counter per destination)

**Scan Workflow:**
```
1. Discover zombie: Scan subnet, find host with sequential IPID
2. Baseline: Measure zombie IPID (N)
3. Spoof SYN: Send SYN from zombie IP to target:port
4. Wait: 100-500ms for target to respond to zombie
5. Post-scan: Measure zombie IPID (N+delta)
6. Interpret:
   - delta=0: Filtered (target didn't respond to zombie)
   - delta=1: Closed (target sent RST to zombie)
   - delta=2: Open (target sent SYN-ACK to zombie, zombie replied with RST)
```

**Research References:**
- **Salvatore Sanfilippo's Idle Scan Paper:** Original technique description
- **Nmap Idle Scan:** https://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html
- **RFC 791 (IP):** IPID field specification (16-bit identification)
- **RFC 793 (TCP):** SYN/SYN-ACK/RST handshake

**Risk Mitigation:**

**Risk:** Zombie host goes active during scan (IPID becomes unpredictable)
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (depends on network environment)
- **Impact:** HIGH (scan results invalid)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Monitor zombie IPID between probes (detect anomalies)
  - If delta >2 unexpectedly, abort scan and find new zombie
  - Recommend scanning during low-traffic hours

**Risk:** Modern systems use random IPID (no suitable zombies)
- **Likelihood:** HIGH (Windows 10+, Linux 4.18+ default to random)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (idle scan unavailable)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Document zombie requirements in guide
  - Provide alternative: Use VPS as controlled zombie (ethical concerns)
  - Suggest legacy systems as zombies (printers, IoT, old servers)

**Risk:** Firewall blocks spoofed packets (idle scan fails)
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (egress filtering common in enterprises)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (idle scan unavailable)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test zombie reachability before full scan
  - Error message: "Zombie unreachable or firewall blocking spoofed packets"
  - Suggest alternative scan type (SYN, stealth)

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Should we support IPv6 idle scanning? (IPID equivalent: Flow Label)
  - **Recommendation:** DEFER to Phase 6. IPv6 uses Flow Label (20-bit) instead of IPID. Different technique.
- [ ] How to handle IPID rollover during large port scans? (65535 ports)
  - **Recommendation:** Track rollover count. If IPID wraps (65535→0), increment rollover counter and adjust delta calculation.

### Sprint 5.4: Advanced Rate Limiting

**Overview:**
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (operational improvement, enhances existing capability)
- **ROI Score:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Duration:** 12-15 hours
- **Effort Breakdown:** 4h ICMP Detection + 5h Token Bucket + 3h Integration + 2h Tests
- **Dependencies:** NONE (enhances existing rate limiter from Sprint 2.3)
- **Risk Level:** LOW (proven patterns, extends existing code)
- **Strategic Value:** Automatic adaptive throttling reduces manual tuning (--max-rate, timing templates). Better stealth through ICMP error detection. Improved reliability on rate-limited networks.

**Rationale:**
Advanced rate limiting follows idle scan because:
1. Builds on existing rate limiter from Phase 2 (Sprint 2.3)
2. Operational improvement for all subsequent sprints (better scanning experience)
3. Medium complexity (12-15h), proven patterns (token bucket, AIMD)
4. Enhances stealth and reliability (detects rate-limiting, adjusts automatically)
5. Quick win before quality foundation sprints (5.6, 5.7)

Current rate limiter uses timing templates (T0-T5) and manual flags (--max-rate, --min-rate). This works but requires user expertise. Advanced rate limiting adds automatic detection of ICMP rate-limit errors (Type 3 Code 13) and per-target adaptive throttling, reducing manual configuration while improving stealth.

**Objectives:**
1. Implement ICMP Type 3 Code 13 detection (Communication Administratively Prohibited)
2. Add per-target token bucket algorithm (separate limits per IP)

   - README.md rate limiting section (+5 lines)

4. **Artifacts:**
   - Performance benchmarks (adaptive vs non-adaptive overhead)
   - ICMP Type 3 Code 13 detection report

**Success Criteria:**

**Functional:**
- [ ] ICMP Type 3 Code 13 detection working (rate-limit errors identified)
- [ ] Per-target token bucket (independent throttling per IP)
- [ ] Exponential backoff (1x → 2x → 4x → 8x on consecutive errors)
- [ ] CLI flags working (--adaptive-rate, --rate-limit-threshold, --backoff-max)
- [ ] Automatic throttling reduces false negatives on rate-limited networks

**Quality:**
- [ ] All tests passing: 1,445 → 1,463 (18 new tests, 0 regressions)
- [ ] Zero clippy warnings
- [ ] Coverage: 85%+ for rate limiting modules
- [ ] Zero panics in rate limiting paths

**Performance:**
- [ ] Adaptive rate overhead <5% (measured by hyperfine)
- [ ] Per-target HashMap operations <1% CPU (low overhead)
- [ ] Memory usage <10MB for 10,000 targets (reasonable HashMap size)

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Rate limiting guide updated with adaptive features
- [ ] Examples provided for --adaptive-rate usage
- [ ] ICMP detection explained
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry complete

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Unit Tests:** 18 minimum (6+6+6)
- **End-to-End Tests:** 2 comprehensive (adaptive rate scenarios)
- **Performance Tests:** Overhead measurement (<5% target)
- **Stress Tests:** 10,000 targets (memory usage validation)

**Dependencies & Prerequisites:**

**Requires Completed:**
- Sprint 2.3: Rate limiter foundation (✅ COMPLETE, 422 lines)

**Blocks:**
- Sprint 5.6: Code Coverage (18 tests contribute)
- Sprint 5.8: Plugin System (stable rate limiting API)

**External Dependencies:**
- No new crates required (existing rate_limiter.rs has token bucket)

**Technical Design Notes:**

**ICMP Type 3 Code 13 Detection:**
- Parse ICMP header (8 bytes): Type (1 byte), Code (1 byte), Checksum (2 bytes), Unused (4 bytes)
- Extract original IP header + 64 bits of original data from ICMP payload
- Map to target IP from original IP header destination field
- Map to port from original TCP/UDP header (first 4 bytes: src port 16-bit, dst port 16-bit)

**Per-Target Token Bucket:**
- HashMap<IpAddr, TokenBucket> stores separate bucket per target
- Initialize with global rate (from --max-rate or timing template)
- On RateLimitDetected: Halve bucket refill rate (degrade)
- On Success: Double bucket refill rate every 30s (restore, max = global rate)
- Exponential backoff: Multiply delay by 2^errors (cap at 8x)

**Exponential Backoff Algorithm:**
```rust
fn calculate_delay(base_delay: Duration, consecutive_errors: u32, max_multiplier: u32) -> Duration {
    let multiplier = 2u32.pow(consecutive_errors).min(max_multiplier);
    base_delay * multiplier
}
```

**Research References:**
- **RFC 792 (ICMP):** Type 3 Code 13 specification
- **Token Bucket Algorithm:** Wikipedia, classic rate limiting algorithm
- **AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease):** TCP congestion control pattern

**Risk Mitigation:**

**Risk:** False positives (non-rate-limit ICMP errors trigger throttling)
- **Likelihood:** LOW (Code 13 is specific to admin filtering)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (unnecessary throttling, slower scans)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Only trigger on Code 13 (ignore Codes 0-12, 14-15)
  - Require 3+ consecutive errors (--rate-limit-threshold)
  - User can disable with --adaptive-rate=false

**Risk:** Performance overhead from per-target HashMap
- **Likelihood:** LOW (HashMap lookups are O(1) average)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (could slow scanning if overhead >5%)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Benchmark during Sprint 5.4 Phase 5
  - Use efficient hash function (FxHashMap from rustc-hash)
  - Prune old entries (remove targets after scan complete)

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Should adaptive rate be default in v0.6.0? (Or keep opt-in?)
  - **Recommendation:** Keep opt-in for v0.5.0 (backward compatibility). Consider default in v1.0.
- [ ] How to handle IPv6 ICMP errors? (ICMPv6 Type 1 Code 1)
  - **Recommendation:** Extend icmp_monitor.rs to handle ICMPv6 in Sprint 5.1 follow-up.

### Sprint 5.5: TLS Certificate Analysis

**Overview:**
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (security auditing, enhances service detection)
- **ROI Score:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Duration:** 10-12 hours
- **Effort Breakdown:** 3h Chain Validation + 3h Weak Cipher + 2h Protocol Downgrade + 2h Integration + 2h Tests
- **Dependencies:** Sprint 5.2 (Service Detection, soft dependency)
- **Risk Level:** LOW (rustls integration straightforward)
- **Strategic Value:** Enables security auditing use case. Detects weak ciphers (RC4, 3DES, export), protocol downgrades (SSLv3, TLS 1.0), expired certificates. Differentiates ProRT-IP from speed-focused scanners (Masscan, ZMap).

**Rationale:**
TLS certificate analysis follows rate limiting because:
1. Enhances service detection from Sprint 5.2 (TLS-wrapped services)
2. Quick win (10-12h), proven patterns (rustls library)
3. Security auditing capability (weak cipher detection, certificate validation)
4. Sets foundation before quality sprints (5.6, 5.7)
5. Demonstrates ProRT-IP isn't just speed, also depth

Sprint 4.15 added basic TLS handshake (CN, SAN, issuer, expiry). This sprint extends to deep analysis: certificate chain validation, weak cipher detection (RC4, 3DES, export ciphers), protocol downgrade detection (SSLv3, TLS 1.0), OCSP stapling validation. Targets security-conscious users (compliance teams, pen testers auditing SSL/TLS configurations).

**Objectives:**
1. Implement certificate chain validation (root CA, intermediate, leaf)
2. Add weak cipher detection (RC4, 3DES, export ciphers, anonymous ciphers)
3. Create protocol downgrade detection (SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1)
4. Add OCSP stapling validation (check revocation status)
5. Add CLI flag `--tls-analysis` for deep HTTPS inspection

- **Integration Tests:** 5 comprehensive (TLS analysis scenarios)
- **Performance Tests:** Overhead measurement (<10% target when enabled)
- **Cross-Platform:** Validate on Linux, Windows, macOS (different root stores)

**Dependencies & Prerequisites:**

**Requires Completed:**
- Sprint 4.15: TLS handshake foundation (✅ COMPLETE, 550 lines)
- Sprint 5.2: Service detection (soft dependency, enhances HTTPS detection)

**Blocks:**
- Sprint 5.6: Code Coverage (15 tests contribute)
- Sprint 5.8: Plugin System (TLS analysis results available to plugins)

**External Dependencies:**
- **New crates:**
  - `webpki-roots = "0.25"` (system root CA store)
  - `x509-parser = "0.15"` (X.509 certificate parsing)
- Both are well-maintained, widely used

**Technical Design Notes:**

**Certificate Chain Validation:**
- Use rustls WebPkiVerifier with webpki-roots (system root CAs)
- Validate: Signatures (each cert signed by next in chain), Validity dates (notBefore/notAfter), Key usage (digitalSignature, keyEncipherment)
- Report: Valid (chain to trusted root), Invalid (reason: expired, untrusted, self-signed)

**Weak Cipher Blacklist:**
```rust
const WEAK_CIPHERS: &[u16] = &[
    0x0005, // TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA (RC4)
    0x000A, // TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA (3DES)
    0x0003, // TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5 (export)
    0x0018, // TLS_DH_anon_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (anonymous)
    // ... (full list ~30 weak cipher suites)
];
```

**Protocol Downgrade Detection:**
- ClientHello: Supported versions = [TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3]
- ServerHello: Selected version = TLS 1.0
- Downgrade detected: Server selected weakest offered version (possible attack)

**Research References:**
- **RFC 5246 (TLS 1.2):** Cipher suite specifications
- **RFC 8446 (TLS 1.3):** Latest protocol version
- **NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2:** TLS/SSL guidelines for federal systems
- **OWASP TLS Cheat Sheet:** Weak cipher recommendations

**Risk Mitigation:**

**Risk:** False positives (legitimate old servers flagged as weak)
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM (many old servers use TLS 1.0/1.1)
- **Impact:** LOW (informational warning, not blocking)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Clearly label "Deprecated" vs "Weak" (TLS 1.0 deprecated but not broken)
  - Provide context (why deprecated, BEAST vulnerability for TLS 1.0)
  - User can ignore warnings if old server is acceptable

**Risk:** Performance overhead from certificate validation
- **Likelihood:** LOW (rustls is fast, chain validation ~10ms)
- **Impact:** LOW (opt-in with --tls-analysis flag)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Make --tls-analysis opt-in (off by default)
  - Cache validation results per IP (avoid re-validating)
  - Benchmark in Sprint 5.5 Phase 5

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Should we validate OCSP stapling? (Check revocation status)
  - **Recommendation:** DEFER to v0.6.0. OCSP adds complexity (HTTP request to CA), low ROI for v0.5.0.
- [ ] How to handle CT (Certificate Transparency) logs?
  - **Recommendation:** DEFER to v0.6.0. CT validation requires SCT (Signed Certificate Timestamp) parsing.
