This document lists the tasks required to bring Phase 4 to full completion and alignment with the project's documentation.

## Phase 4 Completion Tasks

### 1. Service Detection Fix (CRITICAL)

- **Issue:** Service detection is not working as expected. The `metasploitable-test-report.md` shows a 14.3% detection rate (1/7 services).
- **Task:** Investigate the root cause of the low detection rate and fix it.
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours

### 2. Documentation Cleanup

- **Issue:** There are inconsistencies in the documentation regarding version numbers, dates, and test counts.
- **Task:** Audit all documentation and fix the inconsistencies.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

### 3. Phase 4 Compliance

- **Issue:** The `15-PHASE4-COMPLIANCE.md` document lists some missing implementations for Phase 4 (Stateless 1M+ pps, NUMA-aware scheduling, eBPF/XDP bypass).
- **Task:** Review the missing implementations and create a plan to address them in Phase 5 or later.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 hour

### 4. Cleanup `bug_fix/various` Directory

- **Issue:** The `bug_fix/various/` directory contains temporary and historical files that are no longer needed.
- **Task:** Delete the `bug_fix/various/` directory.
- **Priority:** LOW
- **Estimated Effort:** < 10 minutes
